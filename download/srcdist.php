0.4.0</a> - 1585K, .tar.gz format</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Important:</b>
Don't extract the archive with StuffIt, it will corrupt some file
names.

Instructions are in the Installation document.
</p>

<p>
Installation and usage instructions are inside the distribution
tarball.
Please read them - Fink is not a one-click-and-done thing.
The documents README, INSTALL and USAGE are provided as pure text (for
reading from the command line) and as HTML (for reading in a browser
and for printing).
They are also available online in the <a
href="../doc/index.php">documentation section</a>.
