The file LATEST-FINK is a legacy from OS X 10.1 and earlier, and should
be left at "0.4.1a".

The file CURRENT-FINK should be kept up to date with the most recent
distribution release.

The current fink version number must also be supplied in three places:
fink_version.inc, xml/finkdoc.dtd, xml/finkfaq.dtd.


IMPORTANT NOTE: As of 29 June 2003, the CVS modules have been somewhat
rearranged.  It is no longer advisible to check out the "web" module from
CVS.  If you want the website contents, check out the "website" module.
If you want to be able to edit the documentation, including the website,
check out the "xml" module.
