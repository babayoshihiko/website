The file LATEST-FINK is a legacy from OS X 10.1 and earlier, and should
be left at "0.4.1a".

The file CURRENT-FINK should be kept up to date with the most recent
distribution release.

The current fink version number must also be supplied in three places:
fink_version.inc, xml/finkdoc.dtd, xml/finkfaq.dtd.
