Three new Fink releases are 
available
 today: version 0.8.0 (for 10.4),
version 0.7.2 (for 10.3), and version 0.6.4 (for 10.2).
All three releases include source files, binary packages, and a Fink
installer for new users.


The new release for 10.4 includes all currently-available "stable" packages
in source and binary form: there are 1565 of these, which constitutes more
than 80% of the 1909 packages available in the 10.3 release.  Work continues
by the fink developers on bringing more of the stable packages to Tiger.


The new release for 10.2 will be the last official release for that
version of Mac OS X.  Although no further updates (not even security
updates) will be provided by the Fink team, we anticipate that the
0.6.4 release will be usable for years to come.


Users upgrading to 10.4 can now simply issue a 
fink selfupdate command, followed by
sudo /sw/lib/fink/postinstall.pl (for first-time updaters
on 10.4), fink scanpackages and sudo apt-get update.
We don't recommend bootstrapping at the moment, since bootstrapping does
not work with the newly-released XCode 2.1 from Apple.


Note added 6/19/05: If the Fink-0.8.0 binary installer complains that the
volume does not support symlinks, try launching Disk Utility (from the 
Utilities folder inside the Applications folder), selecting the 
problematic volume and clicking on "repair disk permissions."  
Also, the installer requires you to have administrative privileges, so be 
sure that you're running it as such a user.


Note added 6/30/05:  To avoid contamination with obsolete headers and 
the like, we recommend that people who want to build packages from source 
should perform a clean install of XCode via running the 
/Developer/Tools/uninstall-devtools.pl script.  For best 
results, you may want to do this before updating your OS.

Fink 可以在 OS X 10.4 中使用！ 你可以有几种升级的方法：


在最近的几周内，将会有一个安装包发布，提供给那些只使用二进制安装包的用户。

对于那些使用稳定代码树的用户，我们推荐使用 sudo rm -Rf /sw 命令先删除当前的 fink,
然后使用 
fink-0.23.9.tar.gz fink-0.23.9 版本的源代码用 bootstrap 的方式安装。你首先需要从
上面链接下载源代码文件，然后用
tar -xvzf fink-0.23.9.tar.gz 命令解包。在解压后生成的 
fink-0.23.9 文件夹中运行
 ./bootstrap.sh  命令，
然后你需要运行 fink selfupdate 做进一步更新。

对于那些使用未稳定代码树的用户，如果你的版本低于 0.24.5，你可以运行 
fink selfupdate 来安装 fink-0.24.5。在升级到 10.4 
完成后，首先用 fink --version 命令来检查你是不是已经升级到正确的版本。
如果你的版本低于 0.24.5，那么你可以用 fink selfupdate 来获得正确的版本。
然后你可以用 fink reinstall fink 来重新安装 fink 软件包，在这之后再用 
fink selfupdate 做进一步的更新。


目前，并非全部软件包都可以在 10.4 上运行，
但这种情况会在将来的几周内获得改善，稳定代码树中软件包的数量会比 10.3 中的明显地少，
但他们应该都可以编译通过。

当然，还要一些小的细节问题需要完善。
我们鼓励使用 Fink 中软件做为关键应用的用户加入到邮件列表中，以在升级前可以了解其它人时候曾经碰到过问题。

苹果发布了 2004 年十一月的 gcc3 更新，它可以在 connect.apple.com 下载(需要先免费注册)。这个更新修正了 XCode 1.5 中的 gcc3 编译器的问题。如果你正在使用 XCode 1.5，你应该安装这个更新。(这个更新可以正确地更新未经修改的 XCode 1.5，也可以更新那些实施了以前 fink 所推荐的临时办法的用户。)

我们向苹果能够响应我们提交的关于这个问题的报告，并尽快给予解决表示感谢。

在 XCode 1.5 中包括的 gcc 版本已经被发现在某些情况下会对 c++ 代码产生错误的输出。
Fink 现在会对存在这个问题的用户提出告警信息，Fink 也将会拒绝使用有问题的 gcc 来编译一直存在这个问题的软件包。

如果你已经升级 XCode 到版本 1.5，下面是一个临时解决办法，
在 这里
和这里有详细的描述。
如果你还没有升级，你应该考虑继续使用版本 1.2，直到这个问题获得解决。

要安装一个新的 Fink，你可以按照
这里的指南来进行。
你可以在你当前的版本的基础上直接升级到最新的版本。

关于 0.7.0 和 0.7.1 的区别的完整清单可以在
这个页面查看得到。



如果你有任何疑问，请尝试使用 Fink 的邮件列表。你可以在
这里了解到更多的有关知识。



请确定你选择了适合你使用的操作系统版本的合适的安装程序。
Fink 0.6.3 只能安装在 Mac OS X 10.2 上，* 而 Fink 0.7.1 则只能安装在 Mac OS X 10.3 上。*



Fink 团队谨向它众多的贡献者，帮助者和开发者致谢。它们使得这个版本的发布成为了现实。
我们也向我们的用户社区表示感谢，他们下载上一个版本 0.7.0 超过 130,000 次。 
没有他们一直一来的支持和建议，Fink 不可能取得今天的成就。

	In the past few days, there have been reports that some fink packages

	upgraded to XCode 1.5, we suggest that you wait until this issue
	is resolved before doing so.
	
	If you are having problems with a package which compiled under
	XCode 1.2 but does not compile correctly under XCode 1.5, 
	please report the package to
	the fink-devel mailing list.  (The usual symptom is: some symbols
	are  missing after compiling with g++.)  
	Packages already known to have this problem include
	octave, singular-factory, singular-libfac, and possibly sdl.

	The fink-0.22.0 package manager, which was available briefly in the 
	unstable tree this past week, had a bug which prevents further
	updating via rsync.  If you installed this version of fink, you
	can recover by running the command

	to the version in the stable tree, and subsequently running
	fink selfupdate
	
	If for any reason those commands don't work, go to 
	the 
	fink file release page at sourceforge and download the
	file fink-0.22.1.tar.gz (or a more recent, i.e.,
	higher numbered, version).  Unpack this file with
	tar xfz fink-0.22.1.tar.gz , and then from within the

	The fink team apologizes for the error, and thanks the user 
	community for bringing it to our attention quickly.

	Fink's decision to gradually build its own network of mirrors
	has paid off. To make sure that we can continue to offer
	a high quality service we need to improve our mirror network.
	It has been some time since we last asked for more mirrors. 
	It is time to do so again. Fink is very grateful for the resources 
	granted to us by our community. To further improve our service to the 
	community we require an even better mirror system. We especially lack 
	mirrors in central Europe, Russia and the Far East. If you feel that 
	you have at least two Mbit to spare for a rsync mirror, or more to offer 
	a distfiles mirror, please contact us.
	
	
	 To get a better understanding of the different types of mirrors 
	 Fink offers, please review finkmirrors.net. This is the official homepage for all mirror related issues.
	 If you feel that you can offer other types of resources, 
	 web-space for testing as an example, please do not hesitate in contacting us as well.

Thanks to Baba Yoshihiko, Fink has now taken the necessary steps to allow for 
internationalisation efforts. 
The improved infrastructure enables us to display a multilingual web-site to our visitors from all over the world. 


This also means that we need volunteers. The Fink web-site needs to be translated into the language of your choice. 
A translation into Japanese is being worked on and the translation into French has been taken over by Michele Garoche. 
Which language are you willing to translate?


If you are willing to become a member of the internationalisation team or wish to provide feedback on 
the web-site feel free to join the new mailing-list.
You can do so by going to our mailing-lists page. The full announcement on the existing

Thanks to Baba Yoshihiko, Fink has now taken the necessary steps to allow for 
internationalisation efforts. 
The improved infrastructure enables us to display a multilingual web-site to our visitors from all over the world. 


This also means that we need volunteers. The Fink web-site needs to be translated into the language of your choice. 
A translation into Japanese is being worked on and the translation into French has been taken over by Michele Garoche. 
Which language are you willing to translate?


If you are willing to become a member of the internationalisation team or wish to provide feedback on 
the web-site feel free to join the new mailing-list.
You can do so by going to our mailing-lists page. The full announcement on the existing 
mailing lists can be read here.

If you previously had Java 1.4.1 and the Java SDK installed, the new
Java 1.4.2 update from apple will upgrade the Java runtime to 1.4.2,
but will remove the previous 1.4.1 Java runtime and
SDK without upgrading the JDK.  To build Java packages in Fink
you will need to go to
connect.apple.com and download the Java 1.4.2 SDK (free
registration required).

Many of the binary files for 10.3 have been updated, eliminating problems
with qt and kde, among others.  To access the updated files, bring your
index of binary files up-to-date by running the
command sudo apt-get update .  After this, you can use
apt-get, dselect or FinkCommander to install binary files as usual.

	Thanks to the new Fink GNOME Core team, including a lot of hard work by packaging
	newcomer Keith Conger and GNOME 1.x maintainer Masanori Sekino, GNOME 2.4 has
	finally been released to the 10.3 unstable tree.
	
	
	It is there for the taking; please offer some of your time and test these packages
	if you are on unstable already.  Because of the massive number of changes, it is
	expected that there will be issues upgrading or installing the new GNOME.  If you
	have problems, you can reach the GNOME-savvy people at
	fink-gnome-core@lists.sourceforge.net.
	Please do report success stories there as well.  The more good reports we get, the
	faster GNOME 2.4 can be moved to stable.
	
	
	For those of you who do not read our mailing lists, why aren't you subscribed yet?
	Here is a link to detailed 
	instructions 
	how to install or upgrade GNOME and what new stuff it brings.

	A happy new year to all of you from the whole team. Blame this outburst of an 
	attempt at slang language on some of us having to watch the MTV Music Awards all
   day long.
	
	
	Last year has been a good year for Fink. We have had hard times keeping up with 
	the changes introduces by Apple, but we also learned that we have a great community
	which is willing to go through great lengths to support us. 
	For this, we say "Thank You". Much of what happens in the Fink project
   happens because of the amazing support and encouragement we get from our users.
	
	
	Two Zero Zero Four should not make us slow down, but speed up. There are some 
	interesting things in the pipeline, including GNOME 2.4, a new release of KDE, major 
	changes to the package manager itself, and organisational restructuring. 
	Hopefully we will advance into an even bigger project with developer conferences, 
	real life meetings, and a CD in your favourite shop.
	
	
	High ambitions can make one fall very deeply, thus we shall take it carefully, but 
	still we are all counting on your support during this year. Tell us what you think 
	about Fink; tell us what you like or dislike; show us ways to improve ourselves.
	Lend us your resources and sponsor a mirror or hardware. Devote some of your time
	to improve the package manager or add another piece of software by creating an
	info file. Browse this website and hopefully indulge yourself. We enjoy serving
	such a nice community; hopefully we shall make it a smooth ride for you and
	your Macintosh in Two Zero Zero Four.

 The Fink team and I wish all of you a merry Christmas and happy Holidays. We are looking
 forward to yet another year where we can help the Macintosh community grow into the 
 world of UNIX together with Mac OS X.
 		
		
 We wish you all, that your hope is not too frail and that you will carry on following 
 through with your wishes. May the world we live in gradually become a better place and
 may peace and understanding settle just for a few days. 
		
		
 Enjoy your quiet time and in case we do not get around to saying it soon enough. 
 A happy new year to all of you, stay with us we count on your support.
