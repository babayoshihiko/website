  fink-0.38.5 was released on 14 May, 2015.  This release enables

  to restore the requirement that the /usr/X11R6 convenience symlink be present for
  the x11* virtual packages to be active.
  </p>
  <p>
  It also downgrades building libraries with flat namespace from a fatal validation
  error to a warning, since some packages require such a build.  There are a number
  of additional validation enhancements as well.  Check the commit logs on fink's 
  github site for additional information.

  fink-0.36.1 was released on 17 November, 2013.
  This release fixes an intermittent bug in building Perl modules
  which was introduced with fink-0.36.0.  We encourage our users to
  install fink-0.36.1 to rectify this issue, and if you are having
  problems with installing a Perl module, use fink rebuild
  on it.
  </p>
  <p>
  In addition, the bootstrap  script now validates whether the Mavericks 
  command-line build tools are installed on that OS version, and prevents 
  folks from bootstrapping with the wrong tools.
