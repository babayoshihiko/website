<h1>KDE Support In Fink</h1>

<p>
 KDE support in Fink is reaching maturity, and there isn't much reason
 to refer to this page for special notes on installing it anymore.
</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>
 To install all of KDE, install either the <em>bundle-kde-ssl</em> or
 <em>bundle-kde</em> (if the law restricts the use of OpenSSL strong
 cryptography in your country) packages.
</p>

<p>
 For instructions on configuring or removing the KDE packages, the
 instructions in '<em>fink info bundle-kde</em>' should give you everything
 you need to know.  To see a list of available KDE packages, see the
 <a href="http://fink.sf/net/pdb/section.php/kde">KDE section of the
 package database</a>.
</p>

<h1>If You Have Problems...</h1>
<p>
 Before you do anything else, make sure you've read the documentation at
 <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/doc/">http://fink.sourceforge.net/doc/</a>,
 notably the parts on how to install and use packages with fink, dselect, and apt-get,
 and the documentation on installing and using XFree86.  If your questions are not
 answered there, please check the
 <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/lists/index.php">list archives</a> and
 <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=117203&amp;group_id=17203">bug tracker</a>
 before posting questions.  You can also try the
 <b><a href="http://www.aquaflux.org/~fink/">#fink</a></b> channel on
 The <a href="http://www.openprojects.net/">OpenProjects IRC network</a>
 (<b>irc.openprojects.net</b>).  A number of the people involved in the
 KDE port usually hang out there.
