               <p>
The <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net">Fink</a>, 
<a href="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo</a>, 
and 
<a href="http://opendarwin.org/projects/darwinports/">DarwinPorts</a> 
projects are pleased to announce the formation of  a cooperative development 
alliance forged to facilitate delivery of freely available software to 
Mac OS X.  Under this new alliance, the projects will share information and 
coordinate efforts for porting software to 
Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx">Mac OS X</a> 
and <a href="http://www.apple.com/darwin">Darwin</a> operating 
systems.  Members of the alliance will share information using 
the <a href="http://www.metapkg.org">www.metapkg.org</a> Web 
site,  which  will provide a home for this cooperative effort.

               <p>Fink and 
<a href="http://www.macwelt.de/">Macwelt</a> have managed to organise a logo contest.
For the next six weeks everyone is invited to submit their logo creations. 
Fink needs a new face and with your help we might just get one.  We are curious to see what you imagine Fink to be as a graphical representation.
The initial announcement by Macnews is in German, for those of you not capable of reading German a translated version can be found
 <a href="http://fink.sf.net/logo.php">here</a>. 
                </p>
<p>
Fink and Macwelt hope that many of you will participate as we might just find some prices for the winners. Good luck and.... start drawing.

	       <p>KDE 3.1.1 binaries are now available.  Since they
have been released after 0.5.2 came out, you will need to update
your package descriptions by running <code>sudo apt-get update</code>
(or equivalent) before they will be available for installation.
For pointers to the changes and security fixes in this release,
see <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=2068947&amp;forum_id=2022">the
announcement</a>.
