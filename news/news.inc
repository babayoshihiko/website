        <p><a href="http://finkcommander.sourceforge.net/">FinkCommander</a>,
 a separate project which provides a GUI for Fink,
has released version 0.5.0, their first Jaguar-only version.  The new
version includes a package browser which allows you to view the files 
that Fink has installed for a particular package, as well as <a href="http://finkcommander.sourceforge.net/pages/VERSION_HISTORY.html">many 
other improvements.</a>

        <p>
        The Virex 7.2 package, currently being distributed free to all .Mac 
members, has a serious conflict with Fink.  <b>Fink users should not install 
Virex 7.2 under any circumstances.</b>
  Installing it after Fink is installed
will damage your Fink installation; installing it prior to Fink will make
it impossible to install Fink without damaging Virex.

This bug has been <a href="http://forums.mcafeehelp.com/viewtopic.php?t=6318&amp;sid=33d08f3c34f7e09dc546aa1ddf1c299c">reported 
to Virex's manufacturer.</a>  We will keep the
Fink community informed about the situation as it develops.

	<p>
	While Apple's X11 works just fine with existing binaries, it
has a bug in the install name of the libraries that can cause some
software to build incorrectly, and will break forward-compatibility
with future X11 releases.
</p>
<p>
	Ben Hines has created a script (available <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/fink/fix-fink/install_name_fix.pl">here</a>) that you can use
that will fix the install_name entries in Apple's X11 libraries,
but it will not repair software you have already built against the
broken libraries.
</p>
<p><b>Update 11 February 2003:</b> This script is not needed with 
version 0.2 of Apple's X11.app which was released yesterday.
