	UPDATE: We are pleased to announce that SourceForge have resolved the issues with anonymous CVS access, and the selfupdate-cvs command should work again. Further details on the downtime can be found on the SourceForge.net <a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=2352&amp;group_id=1#cvs">site status</a> page.

	with some caveats.  Please read <a href="<?php print $root; ?>doc/x11/inst-xfree86.php#apple-binary">the newly added Apple X11</a> section of the Fink X11 Documentation for details.</p>

	Thanks to Benjamin Reed, it is now possible to receive RSS 1.0 Feeds that contain a lot of valuable information.

<a href="<?php print $root; ?>news/fink-stable.rdf">fink-stable.rdf</a> will tell you about the changes and additions in the stable tree, reflecting packages which have been added or modified.
</p>
<p><a href="<?php print $root; ?>news/fink-unstable.rdf">fink-unstable.rdf</a> will tell you about changes or additions to the unstable tree and is most likely the most active RSS feed.
The above Feeds are automatically updated every 60 minutes to make sure that they keep you all on top of the latest development.
</p>
<p><a href="<?php print $root; ?>news/news.rdf">news.rdf</a> This feed reflects the contents of the Fink News Page. The Feed is updated as soon as a new item is added on the Website.
