<a name="2003-11-1 Fink 0.6.1 released"><span class="news-date">2003-11-1: </span><span class="news-headline">Fink 0.6.1 released</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
        <p>The latest Fink release, version 0.6.1, is now available
for both source and binary users.  This release was built on OS X 10.2
using the gcc 3.3 compiler, and runs well on OS X 10.3.  Most Fink
users who upgrade to 10.3 will want to only use the binaries from this
new distribution for now, while the Fink team continues to modify
Fink packages for 10.3.
</p><p>
If you wish to access the 
new binaries, use apt-get, dselect, or the binary mode of
FinkCommander.  Unless you are interested in helping the Fink team
to test packages which are compiled on 10.3, 
do not use the command-line <code>fink</code> program to do your
installations for the
next few weeks.
</p>
<p>The simplest way to upgrade a binary installation is to run
"sudo apt-get update".  Further details and
other issues related to upgrading Fink to 10.3 are addressed on the
<a href="<?php print $root; ?>blah">Special 10.3 upgrade page.</a>
</p><p>
Before using the latest version of
the command-line <code>fink</code> program 
under OS X 10.2, be sure to install the August2003gccUpdater, available
after free registration from connect.apple.com.

		<p>
		We wish all of you a happy Halloween.
		</p>
		<p>
		Furthermore I would like to welcome our new mirrors to the Fink family.
		From Europe in Rijeka, Croatia a new full mirror joins us. This mirrors 
		has been sponsored by the <a href="http://mac.dir.hr/">Jabucnjak</a> Apple user group. 
		This is our first mirror in Europe, so I hope that more will be joining us 
		soon.
		</p>
		<p>
		Dave Schroeder from the <a href="http://mirror.services.wisc.edu/">University of 
		Wisconsin</a> in Madison is sponsoring a 100Mbit dedicated Master server.
		A. J. Wright and <a href="http://sunsite.utk.edu/">SunSITE@UTK</a> are helping out with 
		another full mirror in the United states. 
		</p>
		<p>
		This raises our full mirror count to four and the rsync mirror count to 
		five. We are happy to have such a great community back us up, but I know 
		that more mirrors will join over time. I will not stop nagging you until
		Fink has its own mirror in every state of the USA. Yet, with such a 
		brilliant community backing us up, I am not too worried about not
		reaching my goal very soon.
		</p>
		<p>
		Trick or treat! Our most wanted treat is more mirrors, so come forth 
		Administrators and fill our bag. Information on how you can be a mirror
		can be found on the official <a href="http://finkmirrors.net">
		mirroring website</a>.

		<a name="2003-10-25 Look Ma, a logo for Fink"><span class="news-date">2003-10-25: </span><span class="news-headline">Look Ma, a logo for Fink</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
	<p>As you surely noticed, Fink has a logo. This is the result of our
	Logo <a href="<?php print $root; ?>logo.php">contest</a> held earlier this year.
	This new, official, logo has been displayed since the 24th of October and
	those of you who wondered how it has been picked and what the name of the
	winner is should read up in the PR <a href="<?php print $root; ?>pr/index.php">section</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	The longer explanation also features a larger version of the logo itself,
	so that you may have a closer look at its details. We like our new logo,
	we hope that you will like it too.
	</p>
	<p>IMPORTANT: We do not yet have a formal licensing agreement for the new
   logo and so are unable to give permission to distribute it.  Currently, it
   can only be displayed on the Fink web page.  Thank you for your understanding.
	</p>
