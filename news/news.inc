    <p>
      Yesterday version 0.10.0 of the Fink package manager was released to the unstable tree, along with version 1.6 of the base-files package. All Fink users which are using the unstable tree are recommended to update to this version. The easiest way to do so usually is to run 'fink selfupdate-cvs' which will automatically take care of updating these essential packages.

      Please report any problems you encounter with this version via our bug tracker.

    <p>
      The Fink binary distribution has moved to a new location. All Fink users wishing to use the binary distribution will have to make sure they are using the new binary distribution (many of you already are using it, maybe without even noticing). If you want to know how to switch and why we do this, <a href="<?php print $root; ?>news/bindist_move.php">read more here.</a>.
