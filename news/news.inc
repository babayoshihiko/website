  <p>
Users should update their XFree86 installations to version 4.2.1.1
for use with OS X 10.2.2.  If you are using system-xfree86, you
can get the new version from the <a href="<?php print $root; ?>https://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=118483">XonX 
project</a>.  If you are using Fink's
xfree86 packages, you should update to xfree86-base-4.2.1.1-1 and
xfree86-rootless-4.2.1.1-1.  These packages are recent additions to
the 10.2/unstable tree; to gain access to them, you may need to run 
&quot;fink selfupdate-cvs&quot; and/or enable the unstable tree

  <p>
  Users are cautioned to use the binary installer for Fink 0.4.1 <b>only
once</b> on a given machine.  Due to an apparent bug in Apple's
Installer.app program, attempting a second installation on the same
machine can result in permissions being altered in the machine's root
directory, in some cases leaving the machine in a non-bootable state.
</p><p> If Installer.app presents you with an &quot;Upgrade&quot; button rather
than an &quot;Install&quot; button when installing Fink 0.4.1, <b>do not proceed
any further!</b> </p>
<p>A new version of the binary installer for Fink 0.4.1 became available
on November 5.  The new version avoids
the problem of the machine not booting, but even with the new version,
users are advised to only &quot;Install&quot;,
not &quot;Upgrade.&quot;  (You can recognize the new version by its filesize of
12582912 bytes, while the old version had a filesize of 10541112 bytes.)

    This is the <b>last release for Mac OS X 10.1</b>. Future versions of Fink will <b>not</b> officially support Mac OS X 10.1 anymore, we are gearing all our efforts towards 10.2.
    </p>
    <p>
    At the same time, this release is not meant for Mac OS X 10.2. Fink 0.5.0. which is targeted for October, will be geared towards 10.2. In the meantime refer to the news item below on how to upgrade Fink for 10.2.
