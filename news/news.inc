	<p>
	Fink's decision to gradually build its own network of mirrors
	has paid off. To make sure that we can continue to offer
	a high quality service we need to improve our mirror network.
	It has been some time since we last asked for more mirrors. 
	It is time to do so again. Fink is very grateful for the resources 
	granted to us by our community. To further improve our service to the 
	community we require an even better mirror system. We especially lack 
	mirrors in central Europe, Russia and the Far East. If you feel that 
	you have at least two Mbit to spare for a rsync mirror, or more to offer 
	a distfiles mirror, please <a href="mailto:mirrors@finkmirrors.net">contact us</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	 To get a better understanding of the different types of mirrors 
	 Fink offers, please review <a href="http://finkmirrors.net/">finkmirrors.net</a>. This is the official homepage for all mirror related issues.
	 If you feel that you can offer other types of resources, 
	 web-space for testing as an example, please do not hesitate in <a href="mailto:mirrors@finkmirrors.net">contacting us</a> as well.

Thanks to Baba Yoshihiko, Fink has now taken the necessary steps to allow for 
internationalisation efforts. 
The improved infrastructure enables us to display a multilingual web-site to our visitors from all over the world. 
</p>
<p>
This also means that we need volunteers. The Fink web-site needs to be translated into the language of your choice. 
A translation into Japanese is being worked on and the translation into French has been taken over by Michele Garoche. 
Which language are you willing to translate?
</p>
<p>
If you are willing to become a member of the internationalisation team or wish to provide feedback on 
the web-site feel free to join the new mailing-list.
You can do so by going to our <a href="<?php print $root; ?>lists/index.php">mailing-lists page</a>. The full announcement on the existing 
mailing lists can be read <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.os.apple.fink.devel/7554">here</a>.
