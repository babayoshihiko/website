	<p>
	While Apple's X11 works just fine with existing binaries, it
has a bug in the install name of the libraries that can cause some
software to build incorrectly, and will break forward-compatibility
with future X11 releases.
</p>
<p>
	Ben Hines has created a script (available <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/*checkout*/fink/fix-fink/install_name_fix.pl">here</a>) that you can use
that will fix the install_name entries in Apple's X11 libraries,
but it will not repair software you have already built against the
broken libraries.

	<p>
        A problem was uncovered today concerning the versions of imlib,
 libpng, and gnome in Fink's unstable tree.  The Fink team is hard at
 work addressing this problem.  As a workaround, users can downgrade
their imlib package to the stable version, &quot;<tt><nobr>fink install
 imlib-1.9.10-9</nobr></tt>&quot;, until the problem is fixed.
</p><p>
   Many Fink users may be using Fink's unstable tree without being
fully aware of what this entails.  For a few months in the fall,
enabling the unstable tree was the only way to gain access to
 10.2-compatible versions of Fink packages.  
<b>That is no longer the case.</b>
Fink users who do not wish to help the Fink team with testing should
disable their unstable tree.  To do this, edit the file
<tt><nobr>/sw/etc/fink.conf</nobr></tt> and remove the items
 <tt><nobr>unstable/main</nobr></tt> and <tt><nobr>unstable/crypto</nobr></tt> from the
 <tt><nobr>Trees</nobr></tt> line.
	</p>
<p>The Fink team appreciates those users who are willing to stick with
the unstable tree, even when there are problems like today's, and provide
the team with prompt feedback.  This is a community effort and we
appreciate your participation.
