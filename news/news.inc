	<p>..who will mirror Fink above all? There is a new player on the turf
	and it belongs to the Fink team. <a href="<?php print $root; ?>http://finkmirrors.net"> Finkmirrors.net</a> tells you everything you wanted to know about mirroring Fink and its related ressources on your Server. As our mirror structure will hopefully grow in the future, this web-site will also hold information about each individual mirror.
	</p>
	<p>To ensure that our service remains as stable as possible and to distribute the load imposed onto our main rsync server, we are look for rsync mirrors or full mirrors. Those of you who are willing to share ressources will find all the necessary information on <a href="<?php print $root; ?>http://finkmirrors.net"> Finkmirrors.net</a>.

<a name="2003-10-12 New update method available"><span class="news-date">2003-10-12: </span><span class="news-headline">New update method available</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
<p>The latest version of the fink package manager offers a new update
method, <code>fink selfupdate-rsync</code>, as an alternative to the
CVS updates which have been so problematic in the past few months.
If you have difficulty updating to the new version, please follow
<a href="<?php print $root; ?>http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/rsync-upgrade.php">these 
special update instructions</a>.
</p>
<p>In addition, this version of the fink package manager is compatible
with last summer's Developer Tools updates.  After installing both the new
package manager and the Developer Tools update, 
fink will ask you to reset your gcc version whenever
that is necessary.</p>
