	<p>
	A happy new year to all of you from the whole team. Blame this outburst of an 
	attempt at slang language on some of us having to watch the MTV Music Awards all
   day long.
	</p>
	<p>
	Last year has been a good year for Fink. We have had hard times keeping up with 
	the changes introduces by Apple, but we also learned that we have a great community
	which is willing to go through great lengths to support us. 
	For this, we say "Thank You". Much of what happens in the Fink project
   happens because of the amazing support and encouragement we get from our users.
	</p>
	<p>
	Two Zero Zero Four should not make us slow down, but speed up. There are some 
	interesting things in the pipeline, including GNOME 2.4, a new release of KDE, major 
	changes to the package manager itself, and organisational restructuring. 
	Hopefully we will advance into an even bigger project with developer conferences, 
	real life meetings, and a CD in your favourite shop.
	</p>
	<p>
	High ambitions can make one fall very deeply, thus we shall take it carefully, but 
	still we are all counting on your support during this year. Tell us what you think 
	about Fink; tell us what you like or dislike; show us ways to improve ourselves.
	Lend us your resources and sponsor a mirror or hardware. Devote some of your time
	to improve the package manager or add another piece of software by creating an
	info file. Browse this website and hopefully indulge yourself. We enjoy serving
	such a nice community; hopefully we shall make it a smooth ride for you and
	your Macintosh in Two Zero Zero Four.

 The Fink team and I wish all of you a merry Christmas and happy Holidays. We are looking
 forward to yet another year where we can help the Macintosh community grow into the 
 world of UNIX together with Mac OS X.
 		</p>
		<p>
 We wish you all, that your hope is not too frail and that you will carry on following 
 through with your wishes. May the world we live in gradually become a better place and
 may peace and understanding settle just for a few days. 
		</p>
		<p>
 Enjoy your quiet time and in case we do not get around to saying it soon enough. 
 A happy new year to all of you, stay with us we count on your support.

	Thank you, thank you, thank you. What a great community we have.
	Thank you for providing us with more mirrors. 
		</p>
		<p>
	Matthew Healey, member of the Western <a href="http://www.wamug.org.au">
	Australian</a> Macintosh User Group, and their 
	ISP <a href="http://www.extremedsl.com.au">extremedsl</a>
	are providing Fink with a full mirror in Perth, Australia. This is our first
	mirror in down under, thus I am pleased to welcome them to the family.
	Furthermore the <a href="http://www.mirror.ac.uk">UKMIRROR</a> service 
	has accepted us, making distfile services available for Fink 
	on 21 load balanced server.
		</p>
		<p>
	We are very happy about this development, but we still need more rsync mirrors.
	Thus, once more, if you feel like helping, please visit 
	<a href="http://finkmirrors.net">finkmirrors.net</a> and get in touch.
