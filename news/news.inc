		<p>
 The Fink team and I wish all of you a merry Christmas and happy Holidays. We are looking
 forward to yet another year where we can help the Macintosh community grow into the 
 world of UNIX together with Mac OS X.
 		</p>
		<p>
 We wish you all, that your hope is not too frail and that you will carry on following 
 through with your wishes. May the world we live in gradually become a better place and
 may peace and understanding settle just for a few days. 
		</p>
		<p>
 Enjoy your quiet time and in case we do not get around to saying it soon enough. 
 A happy new year to all of you, stay with us we count on your support.

	Thank you, thank you, thank you. What a great community we have.
	Thank you for providing us with more mirrors.

	Matthew Healey, member of the Western <a href="http://www.wamug.org.au">
	Australian</a> Macintosh User Group, and their 
	ISP <a href="http://www.extremedsl.com.au">extremedsl</a>
	are providing Fink with a full mirror in Perth, Australia. This is our first
	mirror in down under, thus I am pleased to welcome them to the family.
	Furthermore the <a href="http://www.mirror.ac.uk">UKMIRROR</a> service 
	has accepted us, making distfile services available for Fink 
	on 21 load balanced server.
		</p>
		<p>
	We are very happy about this development, but we still need more rsync mirrors.
	Thus, once more, if you feel like helping, please visit 
	<a href="http://finkmirrors.net">finkmirrors.net</a> and get in touch.

	<p>While we welcome our latest full mirror in Norway, sponsored by Havar Valeur, 
        we crave more. To improve our service to all of you, we would like to ask that
        you evaluate carefully if you maybe do have the resources to become a mirror. 
        </p>    
        <p>     
        All it takes is a 10Mbit link, around 100MB of disk space  and some bandwidth you are 
        willing to share for Fink. The exact setup instructions for rsync mirrors can be found 
        <a href="http://finkmirrors.net/rsync.html">here</a>. Especially mirrors in
        Asia, Australia, New Zealand, South Europe and Middle Europe are welcome, since we have none in 
        those regions yet. If you feel generous and wish to donate even more resources, please visit
        <a href="http://finkmirrors.net">finkmirrors.net</a> to learn about your options.
        </p>    
        <p>     
        The current status of all available rsync mirrors can be viewed on the finkmirrors.net pages as well.
        We hope to improve this service in the future, yet this depends on your willingness to help us out. 
        We are looking forward to many new applications and thank our community in advance. 
        </p>
