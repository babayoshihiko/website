  <p>A new <a href="<?php print $root; ?>download/upgrade.php">Upgrade Matrix</a> is
  now available, for use in upgrading earlier versions of Fink to the
  current version, under either OS X 10.1 or OS X 10.2.  Users upgrading
  under 10.1 will be brought to Fink version 0.4.1a, while users
  upgrading under 10.2 will be brought to Fink version 0.5.0a.

  <p>The Fink team is aware of the shortcomings of the current
  <b>Upgrade Matrix</b> page, which is inadequate for upgrading
to Fink 0.5.0a.  Please be patient as we construct
  a new version of that page, whose existence will be announced
  here.  In the meantime, some of you may wish to use the <a href="<?php print $root; ?>news/jaguar.php">test version of the Jaguar updater</a> which was
made available on 2002-09-08.

  <p>
    Fink 0.5.0a for Mac OS X 10.2 is now complete. (Note: 0.5.0a is a final
    release, and replaces 0.5.0 which was never officially released.) This
    release includes over 700 
    binary packages for OS X 10.2 as well as over 1800 source packages of
    all kinds. 
  </p>
  <p>
      The source release and the binary installer are available now, as well as all binary packages. For information about upgrading, visit the <a href="<?php print $root; ?>download/upgrade.php">Upgrade Matrix</a>. 
  </p>
  <p>
  This release is for Mac OS X 10.2 only. 10.1 users should use Fink 0.4.1.
