      <p>Version 0.29.19 of the <code>fink</code> package manager has just been
      released to the unstable tree.  This version of <code>fink</code>         
      features more verbose output from 'fink --version' for debugging purposes,                                                                               
      as well as recognizing OS 10.6.6.  (Version 0.29.17 works fine            
      on 10.6.6, however.)</p>
      <p>It is expected that this version will migrate to the stable tree soon,
      provided that there are no reports of bad behavior from unstable tree     
      users.</p>
      <p><b>Update, 2011-01-22</b>    <code>fink-0.29.19</code> has been added to stable.</p>
