  <p>Sourceforge is currently down.  Check <a href="https://twitter.com/sfnet_ops">
  the SF.net Operations Twitter feed</a> and 
<a href="http://finkers.wordpress.com/2012/12/10/general-sourceforge-outage/">
  the Finkers blog</a> for status updates.</p>
  <p>For folks who aren't behind firewalls, the best recommendation is to use
  <code>fink selfupdate-rsync</code> since that is currently functional.  If you are
  behind a firewall, the best short-term workaround is probably to ask for specific
  updated package description files by contacting the maintainer
  directly.</p>
 <p>The mailing lists and bug tracker are also down, so as an interim solution
    please file bug reports for unmaintained packages (only) as comments to 
    <a href="http://finkers.wordpress.com/2012/12/10/general-sourceforge-outage">
    the Finkers entry</a>.  For maintained packages, send reports to the maintainer. â€Ž</p>
  <p><b>Addendum: 2012-12-12:</b> Anonymous CVS is working again.</p>
