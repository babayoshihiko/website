  <p>
  <code>fink-0.36.1</code> was released on 17 November, 2013.
  This release fixes an intermittent bug in building Perl modules
  which was introduced with fink-0.36.0.  We encourage our users to
  install fink-0.36.1 to rectify this issue, and if you are having
  problems with installing a Perl module, use <code>fink rebuild</code>
  on it.
  </p>
  <p>
  In addition, the bootstrap  script now validates whether the Mavericks 
  command-line build tools are installed on that OS version, and prevents 
  folks from bootstrapping with the wrong tools.
