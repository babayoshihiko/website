      <p>To make our logistics easier, as well as to make the user experience
      better, we have begun to phase out the unstable tree.  Users won't notice
      any difference unless they have deactivated <code>stable</code> in the
      <code>Trees:</code> line of <b>fink.conf</b>, which was never a
      recommended course of action.</p>

      <p><code>fink-0.31.2</code> was released to the 10.4/unstable and
      10.7/stable trees on 26 September, 2011.  Packages are now built by default
      using the number of parallel threads specified by the <code>MaxBuildJobs</code>
      field set via <code>fink configure</code>.  In addition, maintainers no longer
      have to specify a particular version of <code>fink</code> to use a
      <code>PatchFile</code>, and fixes a Perl issue.</p>
      <p>It is expected that the package will be added to 10.4/stable shortly.</p>
