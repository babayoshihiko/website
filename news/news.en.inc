      <p>
        Version 0.29.20 of the <code>fink</code> package manager has just been
        released to the unstable tree.  This version of <code>fink</code>         
        fixes an issue with X11 detection against recent versions of
        <a href="http://http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki">Xquartz</a>
        on Leopard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless other updates are made in the near term, it is expected that this
        version of <code>fink</code> will be added to the stable tree shortly.
