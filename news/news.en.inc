      <p><code>fink-0.31.4</code> was released to the 10.4/stable and
      10.7/stable trees on 12 October, 2011.  The primary new feature
      in this release is to ensure that the default compiler on OS X 10.6
      is the same for Xcode 3.2.x and 4.2.  In addition, the versions of some
      of the other essential packages which get installed at bootstrap have 
      been updated.</p>

      supported OS X version, and recognizes Growl 1.3 from the App Store.

      <p>To make our logistics easier, as well as to make the user experience
      better, we have begun to phase out the unstable tree.  Users won't notice
      any difference unless they have deactivated <code>stable</code> in the
      <code>Trees:</code> line of <b>fink.conf</b>, which was never a
      recommended course of action.</p>
