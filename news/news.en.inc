    <p>The fink website is not functioning correctly at present.  (You may
have noticed that many of the links on this page do not function correctly.)  The
fink team is working to resolve the problem as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><b>Update, 2008-01-13:</b> The website is back to normal.</p>

    <p>Users who want to update their Leopard X11 installation should make sure to download a <a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/downloads/Xquartz-1.3.0-apple-fink.bz2">Fink-friendly update to Xquartz</a>.  Users who have already applied the X11-2.1.0.1.pkg from macosxforge.org <b>must</b> download the Fink-compatible Xquartz for Fink to work properly.  (Note: there is an X11-2.1.1.pkg release pending which will remove the need to patch your Xquartz.  If you install X11 2.1.1 or later, <b>do not</b> apply the Xquartz patch.)</p>
    <p><b>Update, 2007-12-11:</b> The X11 2.1.1 release <a href="http://trac.macosforge.org/projects/xquartz/wiki/Releases">is now available on the Xquartz release page</a>.  Users who have already applied the X11-2.1.0.1.pkg and/or the patched Xquartz-1.3.0-apple-fink file from macosxforge.org should <b>upgrade to 2.1.1 or greater</b> for Fink to work properly.  This release supercedes all previous releases, including the fink-specific Xquartz.</p>
