      <p>
A new (binary) Fink release for OS X 10.5 (Leopard) is 
<a href="<?php print $root; ?>download/index.php">available</a>
 today: version 0.9.0, which can be installed on either Intel or PowerPC
hardware.
The release includes source files, binary packages, and  Fink
installers for both kinds of hardware.
</p>
      <p>
Users who have already installed Fink on Leopard from source, who now wish
to switch to the binary distribution, may do so as follows.  First,
run <code>fink selfupdate</code> to update to the latest version of the
fink package manager.  Next, run <code>fink configure</code>, and be sure
to <b>change</b> your choice about using the binary distribution from No
to yes.  Finally, run <code>fink scanpackages</code> to activate the binary
distribution.
</p>
<p><b>Update, 2008-07-11:</b> If you use the binary installer, you
should run <code>fink selfupdate</code> after installation.</p>

Every large open source project has to face the problem of distribution and Fink is no different. We want you to get all the files you need to build your favourite application as quickly as possible. A mirror close to your location is a first step to achieving that. 
</p>
		<p>
We are actively working on building a reliable distribution infrastructure consisting of mirrors sponsored by universities and corporations. 
Recently our list of mirrors had to be shortened considerably and we need your <b>help</b> to improve its level of quality again.
</p>

Are you a student? Are you a professor? Do you run a Data Center? Are you a developer with free time to spare? Even if you cannot say yes to any of those questions you still might be able to help.
All the relevant information on how to run and sponsor a mirror can be found on the <a href="http://wiki.finkproject.org/index.php/Fink:FinkMirrors">FinkWiki</a>.
For specific questions you can <a href="mailto:fink-core-private@lists.sourceforge.net">contact us</a> directly.
We are looking for mirrors all over the world, but specifically in these countries:</p>
<ul><li>United States</li><li>Japan</li><li>Germany</li><li>France</li><li>United Kingdom</li><li>Canada</li><li>Italy</li><li>Spain</li><li>Switzerland</li><li>Australia</li></ul>
	<p>
We would like to take this opportunity to thank those who are already providing Fink with mirrors. Without your continued support Fink would not be able to provide the level of service it currently does. Thank you!
