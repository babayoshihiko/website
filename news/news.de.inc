		<p>
Every large open source project has to face the problem of distribution and Fink is no different. We want you to get all the files you need to build your favourite application as quickly as possible. A mirror close to your location is a first step to achieving that. 
</p>
		<p>
We are actively working on building a reliable distribution infrastructure consisting of mirrors sponsored by universities and corporations. 
Recently our list of mirrors had to be shortened considerably and we need your <b>help</b> to improve its level of quality again.
</p>
	<p>
Are you a student? Are you a professor? Do you run a Data Center? Are you a developer with free time to spare? Even if you cannot say yes to any of those questions you still might be able to help.
All the relevant information on how to run and sponsor a mirror can be found on the <a href="http://wiki.finkproject.org/index.php/Fink:FinkMirrors">FinkWiki</a>.
For specific questions you can <a href="mailto:fink-core-private@lists.sourceforge.net">contact us</a> directly.
We are looking for mirrors all over the world, but specifically in these countries:</p>
<ul><li>United States</li><li>Japan</li><li>Germany</li><li>France</li><li>United Kingdom</li><li>Canada</li><li>Italy</li><li>Spain</li><li>Switzerland</li><li>Australia</li></ul>
	<p>
We would like to take this opportunity to thank those who are already providing Fink with mirrors. Without your continued support Fink would not be able to provide the level of service it currently does. Thank you!

<p>The fink website is not functioning correctly at present.  (You may
have noticed that many of the links on this page do not function correctly.)  The
fink team is working to resolve the problem as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><b>Update, 2008-01-13:</b> The website is back to normal.</p>
<a name="2007-12-10%20Leopard,%20X11,%20and%20Fink"><span class="news-date">2007-12-10: </span><span class="news-headline">Leopard, X11, and Fink</span></a><?php gray_line(); ?>
    <p>Users who want to update their Leopard X11 installation should make sure to download a <a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/downloads/Xquartz-1.3.0-apple-fink.bz2">Fink-friendly update to Xquartz</a>.  Users who have already applied the X11-2.1.0.1.pkg from macosxforge.org <b>must</b> download the Fink-compatible Xquartz for Fink to work properly.  (Note: there is an X11-2.1.1.pkg release pending which will remove the need to patch your Xquartz.  If you install X11 2.1.1 or later, <b>do not</b> apply the Xquartz patch.)</p>
    <p><b>Update, 2007-12-11:</b> The X11 2.1.1 release <a href="http://trac.macosforge.org/projects/xquartz/wiki/Releases">is now available on the Xquartz release page</a>.  Users who have already applied the X11-2.1.0.1.pkg and/or the patched Xquartz-1.3.0-apple-fink file from macosxforge.org should <b>upgrade to 2.1.1 or greater</b> for Fink to work properly.  This release supercedes all previous releases, including the fink-specific Xquartz.</p>
