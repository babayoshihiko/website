    <p>The Fink Project announces initial support for Mac OS X Leopard (10.5).</p>
    <p>10.5 users who are starting a new Fink tree will need to do this via bootstrap, until a binary distribution gets generated.  Download fink-0.27.8 <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/fink/fink-0.27.8.tar.gz">here</a>.</p>
    <p>The 10.4-&gt;10.5 update can be accomplished by running fink selfupdate to get fink-0.27.8 .  If you're doing this on 10.5, make sure that you have Xcode 3.0 installed.  After 10.5 is installed, run fink reinstall fink.</p>
    <p>A direct 10.3-&gt;10.5 upgrade path isn't ready yet.  If you're impatient to get going, you'll need to download the fink-0.27.8 tarball and bootstrap a new Fink tree as above.</p>
    <p>Update, 2007-10-29:  Users who have updated from 10.4 to 10.5 should note that using fink cleanup to remove .deb files will remove all of them.  This issue should be resolved in the next update.</p>
    <p>Update, 2007-11-03:  fink-0.27.8 or later should solve the above issue as well as a couple of others that have come up.</p>

<p>Some users of fink's unstable tree are having sporadic difficulties
at the end of building large packages, getting reports like
tar: File changed as we read it which causes the .deb file
not to be built.
</p><p>
The fink team is currently studying this problem to determine a permanent
fix.  For the time being, users experiencing this problem can work around
it by issuing the command fink install tar-1.15.1-14.  It
may be necessary to issue that command after each fink update-all
command, as well.
</p><p>Once the fink team has determined how to solve this problem 
permanently, another announcement will be made here.
</p>
<p> Update: 16 March 2007:  The new version of fink's 
dpkg package resolves this problem.  Unstable users can
now run the update commands normally.

<p> Update: 21 August 2006:  The server has been restored.</p>
	<p> 
The server which hosts four important
fink services (the rsync update, the binary distribution, the "master mirror" 
of source files, and the package database) is down at the moment.  We are
hoping that the server will be restored as early as Monday, August 21,
but are providing these workarounds for use during the period of outage.
</p><p>
To update fink, you must either select an rsync mirror other than the
primary one (see the next paragraph), or use the command
fink selfupdate-cvs.  You only need to give this command
once; subsequent updates will continue to be performed using CVS.
When the server is restored, you can revert to rsync updating by means
of the command fink selfupdate-rsync.
</p><p>
To work around the lack of the binary distribution, and the "master mirror"
of source files, run the command fink configure.  You should
accept the default answers to all of the questions, except the following:
when asked "Should Fink try to download pre-compiled packages from 
the binary distribution if available?" answer "no" (to disable the binary
distribution); when asked if you want to change the mirror settings,
answer "yes", and then you will be asked "What mirror order should fink use 
when downloading sources?".  The answer is "2: Search Master Mirrors last"
(to disable the automatic attempts to use the master mirror server).
Finally, if you have decided to stick with rsync for updates, when asked to
"Choose a mirror for 'RSync SelfUpdate'" you should choose one other than
rsync://master.us.finkmirrors.net/finkinfo/.  Unfortunately, other choices
might not be available to you if you are in the U.S.
</p><p>
Finally, to use the package database during the outage, you can connect
to <a href="http://lists.finkproject.org/pdb">this backup copy of the
package database</a> which is a few weeks out of date.

      <description>

			<p>
				The "10.4-transitional" tree was created as an interim solution to the issues of
				incompatibilities between binaries made using GCC 3.3 (the default Mac OS X 10.3
				compiler) and GCC 4.0 (the default Mac OS X 10.4 compiler).  Now that the work to
				move Fink to using GCC 4.0 is essentially finished, we will be stopping official
				support of the "10.4-transitional" tree in favor of the "10.4" tree as of August
				1st, 2006.
			</p>
			<p>You should not need to do anything if "fink --version" prints "0.8.1.cvs" or "0.8.1.rsync".</p>
			<p>
				As we mentioned <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/news/#2006-07-01%20July%20is%20%22Fink%20Update%20Month%22">previously</a>,
				there are 2 ways to make the switch to the supported "10.4" tree.
			</p>
			<p>
				The simplest way is to remove your Fink installation by deleting it and
				installing fresh using the 0.8.1 installer available from the <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download">download page</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Alternately, to preserve your Fink installation, download the
				<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/fink/scripts-10.4-update-0.4.tar.gz?download">upgrade script</a>
				and read the README for instructions on how to upgrade your existing installation in-place.
				This will re-build your Fink installation from source, upgrading everything in the process.
				Be warned, it can take a lot of time, depending on your fink installation!
			</p>
			<p>
				Feedback on the upgrade script has been very positive; many users have already
				made the switch.  If you have problems, please feel free to mail your issues to
				the <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/lists">discussion lists</a>.
			</p>
<p> Update: 2 June 2007.  Due to changes to the behavior of sudo on 10.4.9, the update script needs a bit of assistance.  Switching to a superuser prompt first via sudo -s will suffice.</p>

Fink users on PowerPC machines are advised to update their copies of
fink from the old "10.4-transitional" tree to the more recent "10.4"
tree.  We plan to discontinue the 10.4-transitional tree
by the end of July, 2006.
</p><p>
Some background: along with OS X 10.4 came a new version of the g++ compiler
(one of the workhorses of Fink), which produced code that was binary
incompatible with previous versions.  Fink, when using the 10.4-transitional 
tree, mixes the new gcc-4.0 compiler with the older g++-3.3 compiler.
This strategy gave us some extra time to make packages compatible with
g++-4.0.  The time has now come to complete that transition, and rely
exclusively on the newer tree.  The update, however, is slightly
complicated since all packages using or providing g++ libraries must
be rebuilt in the correct order.
</p><p>
If you are using OS X 10.4, you can
find out if you need to update your Fink installation
by running the command
fink --version.  If the Distribution version is 0.8.1.cvs
or 0.8.1.rsync, you do not need to update.  However, if the 
Distribution version is 0.8.0.cvs or 0.8.0.rsync, you should update,
as described below.
</p>
<p>
Many users will prefer to remove their fink installations and
start anew with the 0.8.1 installer.  Others will prefer to use the 
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/fink/scripts-10.4-update-0.4.tar.gz?download">10.4-update 
tarball (v. 0.4)</a> (around 12 MB), which includes 
precompiled versions of the basic fink packages as well as a script which
will attempt to update an existing fink installation.  Please consult
the README file which you will find within the 10.4-update directory 
(after unpacking the tarball) for further instructions.
</p>
<p>
Note: Fink users who are upgrading their systems from OS X 10.3 to OS X 10.4
can use the same two options to update their fink installations: they can
either remove their old fink installations and start over, or they can
use the same 10.4-update tarball.  The update script should not be run
until after OS X has been upgraded.

A new Fink release for OS X 10.4 (Tiger) is 
<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/index.php">available</a>
 today: version 0.8.1, which can be installed on either Intel or PowerPC
hardware.
The release includes source files, binary packages, and  Fink
installers for both kinds of hardware.
</p>
      <p>
Fink on the Intel platform is still considered "beta" quality, and a number of
packages (particularly packages in the "unstable" tree) either do not compile,
or compile but do not run.  Work to improve this situation is ongoing.
</p>
<p>
Fink users on PowerPC whose existing fink installation uses the 
10.4-transitional tree (from the 0.8.0 distribution) may upgrade in
one of two ways.  The upgrade process is problematic, due to the change
in ABI of g++ libraries which requires many libraries to be recompiled.
Many users will simply wish to remove their fink installations and
start anew with the 0.8.1 installer.  Others may wish to use the new
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/fink/scripts-10.4-update-0.3.tar.gz?download">10.4-update tarball (v. 0.3)</a> (around 12 MB), which includes

As many Fink users are aware, the Fink CVS repository at sourceforge.net

has not been updated since then, and as of several days ago, the developers
are also unable to update CVS in any form.

briefly on their <a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=2352&amp;group_id=1">site
status page</a>), the old CVS servers will never be brought back in
their current form.  This is likely to mean disruption for fink users,
but at present, we cannot say what form this disruption will take.
</p><p>
Our current advice to fink users is to switch to the 'rsync' method of
updating (by running the command 'fink selfupdate-rsync').  This will at
least give you a fink installation which is current up through May 7.
If a full update to the new CVS situation turns out to be impossible
via fink's normal selfupdate command, we will post instructions here
on how to update when they become available.
</p>
<p>Update 5/24/06: CVS is now functioning again, and users using the rsync
method of selfupdating are getting up-to-date content.  If you are using
the cvs method, and can't (or don't wish to) switch to rsync, you should
download the file fink-mirrors-0.24.15.2.tar.gz from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203&amp;package_id=69685">the
Sourceforge file release page</a>, expand the file, and run the command
./inject.pl from within the fink-mirrors-0.24.15.2 directory.  After this has been done, the fink selfupdate command
should again work normally.

As many Fink users are aware, the Fink CVS repository at sourceforge.net
has not been fully functional since March 30.  The anonymous CVS access
has not been updated since then, and as of several days ago, the developers
are also unable to update CVS in any form.

The Fink team has received reports of problems with the rsync
program which was modified by Apple's new Security Update 2006-001: for some
users, fink selfupdate fails to function after the Security
Update.  (The underlying cause appears to be a problem with the 
--delete option for rsync.)
</p>
      <p>
As a workaround, users can run fink install rsync to use
fink's rsync package rather than the Apple program.  Or, for those users
who need specific features of the Apple program (such as support for
Extended Attributes), another workaround is fink selfupdate-cvs
to switch from rsync to cvs updating.  
</p>
<p>Update 3/13/06: This has been resolved by security update 2006-002,
<a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303453">according
to Apple's documentation</a>.

A preliminary version of Fink for the Intel architecture is now ready.
No binary packages are available, and things are still rough around
the edges, but it should be usable if you are patient!
</p>
      <p>
To install it, you need to install the XCode compiler and SDK packages (at minimum).  Then you need to get the file
fink-0.24.16.tar.gz (or a later version, if it's available)
from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203&amp;package_id=13043">the
Sourceforge file release page for Fink</a>, expand the file, and
run the command ./bootstrap.sh .  At the end of the
bootstrap process, run fink selfupdate and you'll get
the currently available packages.
</p>
      <p>
At last check, there were about 1750 packages in the "stable" tree, but
about 150 of those did not build.  When things are truly stable, another
annoucement will be made here.

Fink is now ready for XCode 2.2, with the exception of the openoffice.org 
packages (which are expected to function again when we switch to the 10.4
tree).  Users are encouraged to upgrade to XCode 2.2 whenever they wish;
XCode 2.2 will be required for running the 10.4 tree when it is released.
</p>
      <p>
On the other hand, in spite of today's announcements from Apple, Fink is
not ready to run on Intel processors.  The Fink team hopes to have an
Intel-ready version of fink released within a few weeks; the Fink team does 
not advise early recipients of new iMacs to install Fink on them, but suggests
waiting until the new version of fink is ready.
</p>
      <p>Fink package maintainers please take note of the new Architecture field, now documented in the packaging manual.

      <p>
Three new Fink releases are 
<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/index.php">available</a>
 today: version 0.8.0 (for 10.4),
version 0.7.2 (for 10.3), and version 0.6.4 (for 10.2).
All three releases include source files, binary packages, and a Fink
installer for new users.
</p>
      <p>
The new release for 10.4 includes all currently-available "stable" packages
in source and binary form: there are 1565 of these, which constitutes more
than 80% of the 1909 packages available in the 10.3 release.  Work continues
by the fink developers on bringing more of the stable packages to Tiger.
</p>
      <p>
The new release for 10.2 will be the last official release for that
version of Mac OS X.  Although no further updates (not even security
updates) will be provided by the Fink team, we anticipate that the
0.6.4 release will be usable for years to come.
</p>
      <p>
Users upgrading to 10.4 can now simply issue a 
fink selfupdate command, followed by
sudo /sw/lib/fink/postinstall.pl (for first-time updaters
on 10.4), fink scanpackages and sudo apt-get update.
We don't recommend bootstrapping at the moment, since bootstrapping does
not work with the newly-released XCode 2.1 from Apple.
</p>
      <p>
Note added 6/19/05: If the Fink-0.8.0 binary installer complains that the
volume does not support symlinks, try launching Disk Utility (from the 
Utilities folder inside the Applications folder), selecting the 
problematic volume and clicking on "repair disk permissions."  Also, the installer requires you to have administrative privileges, so be sure that you're running it as such a user.
</p>
      <p>Note added 6/30/05:  To avoid contamination with obsolete headers and the like, we recommend that people who want to build packages from source should perform a clean install of XCode via running the /Developer/Tools/uninstall-devtools.pl script.  For best results, you may want to do this before updating your OS.</p>

Fink can be used on OS X 10.4!  There are several ways you can update:
</p>
      
        
A binary installer will be available within a few weeks, for binary-only
users.  In the meantime, new users should bootstrap fink 0.23.10, just
as stable users, below.

        
For users of the stable tree, we recommend that you delete your current
fink with sudo rm -Rf /sw and then "bootstrap" an
installation of fink-0.23.10 using
<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203&amp;package_id=13043&amp;release_id=326600">
fink-0.23.10.tar.gz</a>--download that file and expand it, 
eg. via
tar -xvzf fink-0.23.10.tar.gz.  After running the command
 ./bootstrap.sh  in the resulting
fink-0.23.10 directory,
you'll need to run fink selfupdate

        
For users of the unstable tree, you may be able to upgrade just by running 
fink selfupdate if your version of fink is less than 0.24.6.  
It will install fink-0.24.6 for you.  After upgrading to 10.4, first check 
that you have the right version of fink by issuing fink --version
.  If your version is less than 0.24.6, run fink selfupdate to 
get the right version of fink.  Then, whether you selfupdated or not, 
reinstall the fink package using fink rebuild fink, 
and follow that with another fink selfupdate.

      
      <p>Not all packages are working yet under 10.4, but that situation will
improve over the next several weeks.  The stable tree contains substantially
fewer packages than in 10.3, but all of them should compile.
</p>
      <p>Of course, some wrinkles still need to be ironed out.  We encourage 
users with mission-critical applications to check in on the mailing 
lists to verify whether anyone has had experience with the package in 
question before upgrading.</p>

Apple has released the November 2004 gcc3 updater, available (upon free 
registration) at connect.apple.com.  This updater fixes the problems with
the gcc3 compiler in XCode 1.5.  If you are using XCode 1.5, you should 
install this updater.  (The updater will update correctly for users with
an untouched XCode 1.5, and also for users who installed the workaround which
the fink project had previously recommended.)
</p>
      <p>
We would like to thank Apple for responding to our reports about this
matter, and working to resolve it as quickly as possible.
