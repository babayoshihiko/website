  <p>Sourceforge is currently down.  Check <a href="https://twitter.com/sfnet_ops">
  the SF.net Operations Twitter feed</a> and 
<a href="http://finkers.wordpress.com/2012/12/10/general-sourceforge-outage/">
  the Finkers blog</a> for status updates.</p>
  <p>For folks who aren't behind firewalls, the best recommendation is to use
  fink selfupdate-rsync since that is currently functional.  If you are
  behind a firewall, the best short-term workaround is probably to ask for specific
  updated package description files by contacting the maintainer
  directly.</p>
 <p>The mailing lists and bug tracker are also down, so as an interim solution
    please file bug reports for unmaintained packages (only) as comments to 
    <a href="http://finkers.wordpress.com/2012/12/10/general-sourceforge-outage">
    the Finkers entry</a>.  For maintained packages, send reports to the maintainer. &#8206;</p>

   <p>Mountain Lion is now available to the general public.  Ideally, users should update
 to fink-0.34.0 or later before updating their OS.  In addition, Xcode 4.4 
 (or at least its command line tools) is required--it can be installed under Lion, but 
 there is a separate version of the Command Line Tools for Mountain Lion, so make sure
 to install those.  Use </p><p>fink list xcode</p><p>to verify that you have the
 Xcode 4.4 command-line tools installed, and that Fink knows where your Xcode.app is.
 If the CLI tools are missing or not for Xcode 4.4, reinstall them, e.g. via the Xcode 
 Preferences.  If fink isn't finding your Xcode.app, use</p>
 <p>sudo xcode-select -switch /path/to/Xcode.app</p>
 <p>to make sure that your system's tools are pointing to the right place.  Also run</p>
 <p>sudo xcodebuild -license</p><p>to make sure that the Xcode license is accepted
 globally on your system, especially for fink's build user.</p>
 <p>Once you have updated the OS, use</p>
 <p>fink reinstall fink</p><p>to point it to the 10.8 distribution, and run</p>
 <p>fink install perl5123-core</p><p>to make sure any Perl modules you have
 from Lion will still work.</p>
 <p>If you updated the OS first,
  and have an earlier version of fink which doesn't know about Mountain Lion, you
  have probably found that it doesn't work.  To work around this issue, do the 
  following: (1) download an updated copy of 
  <a href="https://raw.github.com/fink/fink/master/perlmod/Fink/Services.pm">
  Services.pm</a>, (2) move the downloaded file into /sw/lib/perl5/Fink, such as
  via</p><p>sudo mv /path/to/Services.pm /sw/lib/perl5/Fink</p><p>; 
  (change /sw and /path/to to match 
  your particular setup); (3) run</p><p>fink selfupdate</p><p>, which should
  download and install fink-0.34.0; (4) use </p><p>fink reinstall fink</p>
  <p>to ensure that fink is pointing at the 10.8 distribution, 
  and (5) install perl5123-core
  as above.</p>
  <p>Addendum, 2012-07-26:  It appears that the OS update wipes out the
  users that Fink creates (but not the groups).  After following the steps above, you should
  (1) Run</p><p>fink configure</p><p> to set the Fink build user back up, and 
  (2) use </p><p>fink list -it passwd | cut -f2 | xargs fink reinstall</p><p> to reinstall
  the various passwd* packages and their users.</p>

   (i.e. most packages) if certain su or sudo options were 
   chosen.  In addition, packages now log the md5 sums of all of their files for diagnostic
   purposes.  And users who are only using the Xcode Command-Line Tools will enjoy not

   <p>fink-0.33.0 was released on 6 June, 2012.  This release introduces some new
    features:</p>
   <p>Starting with this version of fink, packages will be built as an unprivileged
   user by default, which prevents the build process from installing files in the rest of the
   filesystem. (Prior to fink-0.33.0 we relied on maintainers to test their packages
   using this method).  Users may find that some packages don't build in this mode, so we appreciate
   feedback, as always, to help us find and correct problems.</p>
   <p>In addition, we have added some additional options for maintainers in this Fink version.
   /sw/Library/Python has been added to the list of valid directories in a package, to
   provide a unified location to install modules built against a built-in Python.  There is
   now an xcode.app virtual package for packages that use xcodebuild
   to BuildDepend upon.  Its version is the version of Xcode.app.  The xcode
   virtual package has always been based on the presence of the command-line tools, and now its
   version is the version of those.  Note that xcode and xcode.app
   are the same for Xcodes prior to 4.3.</p>
