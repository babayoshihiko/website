    <description>
	As you surely noticed, Fink has a logo. This is the result of our
	Logo contest held earlier this year.
	This new, official, logo has been displayed since the 24th of October and
	those of you who wondered how it has been picked and what the name of the
	winner is should read up in the PR section.
	
	
	The longer explanation also features a larger version of the logo itself,
	so that you may have a closer look at its details. We like our new logo,
	we hope that you will like it too.
	
	IMPORTANT: Due to no formal licensing agreement as of yet, it is forbidden for any third party to display this logo. Thank you for your understanding

    <title>Upgrade to gcc 3.3 and/or 10.3</title>
    <link>http://fink.sf.net/news/#2003-10-24%20Upgrade%20to%20gcc%203.3%20and%2For%2010.3</link>
    <dc:date>2003-10-24</dc:date>
    <description>
	It is now possible to upgrade Fink to take full advantage of the gcc 3.3
compiler, or to use OS X 10.3 if you have that installed.  Binary packages
corresponding to these upgrades are not yet available, so if you make 
extensive use of binary packages you may wish to wait a few days before 
upgrading.

If you wish to perform this upgrade, and you had previously installed the
June 2003 Developer Tools update from Apple, you will need to install
the August 2003 Developer Tools update BEFORE you upgrade Fink.  Under
10.3, be sure to install XCode from the XCode disk before upgrading
Fink.

Running &quot;fink selfupdate&quot; should perform the upgrade for you.  The latest
version of the fink package manager will automatically detect which
version of OS X and which version of gcc you have installed, and will
adjust itself accordingly.

If you wish to do a fresh install of Fink on a 10.3 system, we recommend
bootstrapping from
source, starting from fink-full-0.6.0.tar.gz available
on fink's sourceforge 
download page.  You'll need XCode for this as
well.

The Fink team is still working on getting Fink packages working under 10.3,
but many many packages already work.

	To ensure that our service remains as stable as possible and to distribute the load imposed onto our main rsync server, we are looking for rsync mirrors or full mirrors. Those of you who are willing to share resources will find all the necessary information on  Finkmirrors.net.

The latest version of the fink package manager offers a new update
method, fink selfupdate-rsync, as an alternative to the
CVS updates which have been so problematic in the past few months.
If you have difficulty updating to the new version, please follow
these 
special update instructions.

In addition, this version of the fink package manager is compatible
with last summer's Developer Tools updates.  After installing both the new
package manager and the Developer Tools update, 
fink will ask you to reset your gcc version whenever
that is necessary.

As announced in this CERT 
advisory, it has recently been discovered that
the ftp servers for GNU software were compromised back in March, 
although it is not believed that any of the source code housed there
was affected.

Fink relies on MD5 checksums when downloading software, and we have had
no reports of incorrect checksums in Fink packages.  The Free Software
Foundation is in the process of verifying the integrity of all of the
source code distributed from that ftp site.  As of this writing, the source
code for the following Fink packages have not yet been verified:
autoconf2.54,
emacs21,
gprolog,
groff,
guile16,
help2man,
jwhois,
libtool14,
libosip1,
sed,
slib.
It may be difficult to install those packages at present.

    <link>http://fink.sf.net/news/#2003-06-26%20Developer%20Tools%20Update.</link>
    <dc:date>2003-06-26</dc:date>
    <description>
Quick Summary: DO NOT INSTALL THIS UPDATE.
               
Apple has released a patch to the December 2002 
Developer Tools which includes gcc 3.3,
their new compiler.

Fink does not yet support compiling with gcc 3.3.  In addition, it is important
not to &quot;mix and match&quot; between compilers:  all C++ code in fink packages
needs to be compiled
with the same compiler.

For this reason, the Fink team recommends that if you update your
Developer Tools with the new patch, you should be careful to run
sudo gcc_select 3
prior to any &quot;fink build&quot; or &quot;fink install&quot; commands.

Update 30 June 2003: A 
problem
has now been detected with
the new assembler program which the update installs, which may prevent
certain Fink packages from being compiled at all if you install this
update.  

Generally, Fortran programs will break if you install the update;
the breakage does not stop by simply switching back to gcc 3.1.
The Fink team is working on a workaround for this problem, but until it
is ready, if you need Fortran-related programs you should not install
the update.

Fink and MacWelt hope that many of you will participate as we might just find some prices for the winners. Good luck and.... start drawing.

Early reports indicate that upgrading Virex from 7.2 to 7.2.1
still leaves some problems however.  If you upgrade Virex with Fink not
installed, and subsequently
wish to install Fink, you will need to delete the /sw
directory by hand before installing.  And if you upgrade Virex with
Fink already installed, you should immediately run

fink reinstall openssl-shlibs dlcompat-shlibs curl-ssl-shlibs

to restore files which the Virex upgrade may have deleted.

	Ben Hines has created a script (available here) that you can use

        A problem was uncovered today concerning the versions of imlib,
 libpng, and gnome in Fink's unstable tree.  The Fink team is hard at
 work addressing this problem.  As a workaround, users can downgrade
their imlib package to the stable version, &quot;fink install
 imlib-1.9.10-9&quot;, until the problem is fixed.

   Many Fink users may be using Fink's unstable tree without being
fully aware of what this entails.  For a few months in the fall,
enabling the unstable tree was the only way to gain access to
 10.2-compatible versions of Fink packages.  
That is no longer the case.
Fink users who do not wish to help the Fink team with testing should
disable their unstable tree.  To do this, edit the file
/sw/etc/fink.conf and remove the items
 unstable/main and unstable/crypto from the
 Trees line.
	
The Fink team appreciates those users who are willing to stick with
the unstable tree, even when there are problems like today's, and provide
the team with prompt feedback.  This is a community effort and we
appreciate your participation.
