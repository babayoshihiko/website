  fink-0.36.4 was released on 6 April, 2014.
  This fink release restores the use of an official binary distribution by
  default on 10.8 and 10.9 (if distributions are created for 10.6 and 10.7
  those will be supported, too).  In addition, it works around the multiple
  build failures introduced by Xcode 5.1 on 10.8 and 10.9. This release also includes 
  official support for OS X 10.9.2, fixes the bootstrap operation when Xcode.app isn't
  present, and makes x86_64 the default architecture for 10.6 bootstraps.
  </p>
  <p>Users are encouraged to run fink selfupdate to install this version of
  fink, particularly in view of the Xcode 5.1 build issues.</p>

  fink-0.36.1 was released on 17 November, 2013.
  This release fixes an intermittent bug in building Perl modules
  which was introduced with fink-0.36.0.  We encourage our users to
  install fink-0.36.1 to rectify this issue, and if you are having
  problems with installing a Perl module, use fink rebuild
  on it.

  <p>
  In addition, the bootstrap  script now validates whether the Mavericks 
  command-line build tools are installed on that OS version, and prevents
