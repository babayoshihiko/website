      <description>
      <p>Apple has announced that OS X 10.7 "Lion" will be released 
in July.  We want to let Fink users know what to expect when Lion is 
released.</p>
<p>First, the fink 
program itself will not run  on a system which has
been upgraded to Lion.  However, it will be possible to use the
dpkg program to extract a list of the Fink packages
which had been installed under 10.6, so that they can be reinstalled
under 10.7.  Use</p>
<p>dpkg --get-selections | cut -f1 &gt; fink_packages.txt</p>
<p>to extract the packages, and</p>
<p>cat fink_packages.txt | xargs fink install</p>
<p>once you have installed Fink for 10.7.</p>
<p>(To upgrade fink after upgrading to Lion, one will have to bootstrap
fink again, using a new version of fink which will be released shortly
after Lion has been released.  Watch this space for an announcement.)</p>
<p>Second, due to lots of changes under the hood, there will initially
be many fewer Fink packages which work under 10.7 as opposed to 10.6.
Thus, even if you've extracted a list of Fink packages which had
been installed under 10.6, some of them may not yet be installable under
10.7.  We are currently creating a database showing which packages
can be successfully installed under 10.7, but that database
may not be complete prior to the release of Lion.</p>
<p>10.7 introduces several drastic changes to how the system works. While this may
cause a slight delay in full Fink functionality in the short term, it will
make Fink work better in the future.</p>

      If you have not seen updates in a while, then you may wish to change your

      and replacing the line that starts with Mirror-rsync with

      <p>The Fink project was started in the waning days of December 2000 by
Christoph Pfisterer, using the "public beta" release of Mac OS X.
Within a year, versions 10.0 and 10.1 of OS X had been released, and
Fink usage took off.  Our founder chrisp stepped away from the project
in November 2001, and the community took over.</p>
<p>The Fink community is the heart of Fink, involving both package maintainers
and Fink users, as well as the small core team which tries to keep the
overall system in good shape.  The success of this community in keeping
Fink viable and active over ten years is really quite remarkable!  Let's
all join together to keep Fink going for a long time to come.</p>
<p>How long?  In the memorable words of Buzz Lightyear: To Infinity
and Beyond!</p>
