      <p>We are experiencing a temporary failure in some of the rsync mirrors.
      If you have not seen updates in a while, then you may wish to change your
      rsync mirror for the time being by editing /sw/etc/fink.conf as a superuser
      and replacing the line that starts with Mirror-rsync with
        Mirror-rsync: rsync://fink.gecko.ig42.org/finkinfo/</p>
        <p>or</p><p>

         <p>or</p><p>
        Mirror-rsync: rsync://ams.nl.eu.finkmirrors.net/finkinfo/</p>       
      <p>If you prefer, you can select the latter three of the above mirrors via fink configure
      as well:  choose Asia (option 2) as your continent, Japan (10) as your country,
      and rsync://distfiles.hnd.jp.asi.finkmirrors.net/finkinfo/ (2) as the Rsync Selfupdate mirror;
      or choose Europe (4), then Germany (13) and rsync://ber.de.eu.finkmirrors.net/finkinfo/

      <p>The Fink project was started in the waning days of December 2000 by
Christoph Pfisterer, using the "public beta" release of Mac OS X.
Within a year, versions 10.0 and 10.1 of OS X had been released, and
Fink usage took off.  Our founder chrisp stepped away from the project
in November 2001, and the community took over.</p>
<p>The Fink community is the heart of Fink, involving both package maintainers
and Fink users, as well as the small core team which tries to keep the
overall system in good shape.  The success of this community in keeping
Fink viable and active over ten years is really quite remarkable!  Let's
all join together to keep Fink going for a long time to come.</p>
<p>How long?  In the memorable words of Buzz Lightyear: To Infinity
and Beyond!</p>

      <description>
      <p>The recent 10.5 and 10.6 Java updates (APPLE-SA-2010-10-20-1 Java for Mac OS X 10.6 Update 3
      and APPLE-SA-2010-10-20-2 Java for Mac OS X 10.5 Update 8 )
      change the Java file configuration in such a manner that fink
      no longer generates the system-java16-dev package on 10.5 and
      all of the system-java-dev packages on 10.6.</p>
      <p>Users may wish to hold off on applying this update until
      a version of fink which addresses this issue is released.
      The issue does not affect packages which are currently installed, but will
      prevent java-dependent packages from building.</p>
      <p>Users will want to download an appropriate version of the Java Developer Package
      from <a href="http://connect.apple.com/">The Apple Developer Connection site</a>.</p>
      <p>Update, 2010-10-23:  The issue has been addressed in fink-0.29.15.</p>

      <p>The recent 10.5 and 10.6 Java updates (APPLE-SA-2010-10-20-1 Java for Mac OS X 10.6 Update 3
      and APPLE-SA-2010-10-20-2 Java for Mac OS X 10.5 Update 8 )
      change the Java file configuration in such a manner that fink
      no longer generates the system-java16-dev package on 10.5 and
      all of the system-java-dev packages on 10.6.</p>
      <p>Users may wish to hold off on applying this update until
      a version of fink which addresses this issue is released.

      <p>fink-0.29.14 has been released to the unstable tree.
      This version of finkcontains, among
      other new features, an aria2 option for DownloadMethod,
      to allow the use of the aria2 download accelerator
      (available via Fink), and a fix for the infamous "node exists" error.  
      </p>
      <p>It is planned to add this version to the stable tree shortly.</p>
      <p>Addendum, 2010-10-19:  because of the Java update (2010-10-20),
      fink-0.29.15 is now slated to be the version next to go to stable.</p>
