page.



If you have questions or problems, please try the Fink mailing lists.  You can learn more about them
here.



Please make sure you pick the appropriate installer for your platform.
Fink 0.6.3 will only install on Mac OS X 10.2,* while Fink 0.7.1 will only install on Mac OS X 10.3.*


        
The Fink Team would like to thank its many contributors, frequent helpers
and developers for making this release happen.
We also thank our community for downloading the prior release 0.7.0 more than 130,000 times. 
Without their constant support and valuable pointers Fink would not be where we are now.

	In the past few days, there have been reports that some fink packages 
	do not compile correctly using XCode 1.5.  If you have not already
	upgraded to XCode 1.5, we suggest that you wait until this issue
	is resolved before doing so.
	
	If you are having problems with a package which compiled under
	XCode 1.2 but does not compile correctly under XCode 1.5, 
	please report the package to
	the fink-devel mailing list.  (The usual symptom is: some symbols
	are  missing after compiling with g++.)  
	Packages already known to have this problem include
	octave, singular-factory, singular-libfac, and possibly sdl.

    <description>
	
	The fink-0.22.0 package manager, which was available briefly in the 
	unstable tree this past week, had a bug which prevents further
	updating via rsync.  If you installed this version of fink, you
	can recover by running the command 
	fink install fink-0.21.2-1 which will downgrade fink
	to the version in the stable tree, and subsequently running
	fink selfupdate
	
	If for any reason those commands don't work, go to 
	the 
	fink file release page at sourceforge and download the
	file fink-0.22.1.tar.gz (or a more recent, i.e.,
	higher numbered, version).  Unpack this file with
	tar xfz fink-0.22.1.tar.gz , and then from within the
	fink-0.22.1 directory, run the command ./inject.pl
	
	
	The fink team apologizes for the error, and thanks the user 
	community for bringing it to our attention quickly.

	Fink's decision to gradually build its own network of mirrors
	has paid off. To make sure that we can continue to offer
	a high quality service we need to improve our mirror network.
	It has been some time since we last asked for more mirrors. 
	It is time to do so again. Fink is very grateful for the resources 
	granted to us by our community. To further improve our service to the 
	community we require an even better mirror system. We especially lack 
	mirrors in central Europe, Russia and the Far East. If you feel that 
	you have at least two Mbit to spare for a rsync mirror, or more to offer 
	a distfiles mirror, please contact us.
	
	
	 To get a better understanding of the different types of mirrors 
	 Fink offers, please review finkmirrors.net. This is the official homepage for all mirror related issues.
	 If you feel that you can offer other types of resources, 
	 web-space for testing as an example, please do not hesitate in contacting us as well.

Thanks to Baba Yoshihiko, Fink has now taken the necessary steps to allow for 
internationalisation efforts. 
The improved infrastructure enables us to display a multilingual web-site to our visitors from all over the world. 


This also means that we need volunteers. The Fink web-site needs to be translated into the language of your choice. 
A translation into Japanese is being worked on and the translation into French has been taken over by Michele Garoche. 
Which language are you willing to translate?


If you are willing to become a member of the internationalisation team or wish to provide feedback on 
the web-site feel free to join the new mailing-list.
You can do so by going to our mailing-lists page. The full announcement on the existing 
mailing lists can be read here.

If you previously had Java 1.4.1 and the Java SDK installed, the new
Java 1.4.2 update from apple will upgrade the Java runtime to 1.4.2,
but will remove the previous 1.4.1 Java runtime and
SDK without upgrading the JDK.  To build Java packages in Fink
you will need to go to
connect.apple.com and download the Java 1.4.2 SDK (free
registration required).

Many of the binary files for 10.3 have been updated, eliminating problems
with qt and kde, among others.  To access the updated files, bring your
index of binary files up-to-date by running the
command sudo apt-get update .  After this, you can use
apt-get, dselect or FinkCommander to install binary files as usual.

	Thanks to the new Fink GNOME Core team, including a lot of hard work by packaging
	newcomer Keith Conger and GNOME 1.x maintainer Masanori Sekino, GNOME 2.4 has
	finally been released to the 10.3 unstable tree.
	
	
	It is there for the taking; please offer some of your time and test these packages
	if you are on unstable already.  Because of the massive number of changes, it is
	expected that there will be issues upgrading or installing the new GNOME.  If you
	have problems, you can reach the GNOME-savvy people at
	fink-gnome-core@lists.sourceforge.net.
	Please do report success stories there as well.  The more good reports we get, the
	faster GNOME 2.4 can be moved to stable.
	
	
	For those of you who do not read our mailing lists, why aren't you subscribed yet?
	Here is a link to detailed 
	instructions 
	how to install or upgrade GNOME and what new stuff it brings.

	A happy new year to all of you from the whole team. Blame this outburst of an 
	attempt at slang language on some of us having to watch the MTV Music Awards all
   day long.
	
	
	Last year has been a good year for Fink. We have had hard times keeping up with 
	the changes introduces by Apple, but we also learned that we have a great community
	which is willing to go through great lengths to support us. 
	For this, we say "Thank You". Much of what happens in the Fink project
   happens because of the amazing support and encouragement we get from our users.
	
	
	Two Zero Zero Four should not make us slow down, but speed up. There are some 
	interesting things in the pipeline, including GNOME 2.4, a new release of KDE, major 
	changes to the package manager itself, and organisational restructuring. 
	Hopefully we will advance into an even bigger project with developer conferences, 
	real life meetings, and a CD in your favourite shop.
	
	
	High ambitions can make one fall very deeply, thus we shall take it carefully, but 
	still we are all counting on your support during this year. Tell us what you think 
	about Fink; tell us what you like or dislike; show us ways to improve ourselves.
	Lend us your resources and sponsor a mirror or hardware. Devote some of your time
	to improve the package manager or add another piece of software by creating an
	info file. Browse this website and hopefully indulge yourself. We enjoy serving
	such a nice community; hopefully we shall make it a smooth ride for you and
	your Macintosh in Two Zero Zero Four.

 We wish you all, that your hope is not too frail and that you will carry on following 
 through with your wishes. May the world we live in gradually become a better place and
 may peace and understanding settle just for a few days. 
		
		
 Enjoy your quiet time and in case we do not get around to saying it soon enough. 
 A happy new year to all of you, stay with us we count on your support.

	Thank you, thank you, thank you. What a great community we have.
	Thank you for providing us with more mirrors. 
		
		
	Matthew Healey, member of the Western 
	Australian Macintosh User Group, and their 
	ISP extremedsl
	are providing Fink with a full mirror in Perth, Australia. This is our first
	mirror in down under, thus I am pleased to welcome them to the family.
	Furthermore the UKMIRROR service 
	has accepted us, making distfile services available for Fink 
	on 21 load balanced server.
		
		
	We are very happy about this development, but we still need more rsync mirrors.
	Thus, once more, if you feel like helping, please visit 
	finkmirrors.net and get in touch.

	While we welcome our latest full mirror in Norway, sponsored by Havar Valeur, 
        we crave more. To improve our service to all of you, we would like to ask that
        you evaluate carefully if you maybe do have the resources to become a mirror. 
            
             
        All it takes is a 10Mbit link, around 100MB of disk space  and some bandwidth you are 
        willing to share for Fink. The exact setup instructions for rsync mirrors can be found 
        here. Especially mirrors in
        Asia, Australia, New Zealand, South Europe and Middle Europe are welcome, since we have none in 
        those regions yet. If you feel generous and wish to donate even more resources, please visit
        finkmirrors.net to learn about your options.
            
             
        The current status of all available rsync mirrors can be viewed on the finkmirrors.net pages as well.
        We hope to improve this service in the future, yet this depends on your willingness to help us out. 
        We are looking forward to many new applications and thank our community in advance.

    <link>http://fink.sourceforge.net/news/#2003-11-17%20Fink%200.6.2%20released</link>
    <dc:date>2003-11-17</dc:date>
    <description>
        The latest Fink release, version 0.6.2, is now available
for both source and binary users.  This is a bug-fix release, intended
to address two problems: the dselect/user deletion bug, and a 
problem with ownership of files.  The dselect bug was addressed by
updating the fink, dpkg, and apt packages.  After updating to 0.6.2,
it is safe to once again use dselect.  However, if you ran dselect
at any time since 0.6.0, you should carefully check the integrity
of the file at /sw/etc/apt/sources.list.  If you have
any doubts about this file, you should replace it with
the default sources.list file.

Users who have installed binary files from the 0.6.1 distribution
may find that certain files in their Fink installation are owned
by UID 2011 rather than by root.  To correct this problem,
run the command:
sudo find /sw/ -user 2011 -exec chown root:admin {} \;
This release, like the previous one, was built on OS X 10.2
using the gcc 3.3 compiler, and runs fine with some exceptions* on OS X 10.3.  Most Fink 
users who upgrade to 10.3 will continue to
want to only use the binaries from this
new distribution for now, while the Fink team continues to modify
Fink packages for 10.3.

*Exceptions include: emacs, qt.

    <description>
Quick Summary: DO NOT USE DSELECT, and if you've used it,
check your /sw/etc/apt/sources.list file carefully.
		Users who have bootstrapped or installed Fink 0.5.3 or Fink 0.6.0
		on Mac OS X 10.3 could exhibit a problem where all users get deleted
		from the netinfo database, and you become unable to log in.
We believe that this problem can only occur if you've used dselect.
		If you are using Mac OS X 10.3, please be sure you're using the
		latest Fink version to avoid the issue.  To make sure you don't have
		upgrade problems, check your /sw/etc/apt/sources.list
		file.  You will need to modify it if it contains deb
		lines that point to "release" or "current" without a version number.
		In other words, if your sources.list file contains
		these lines:
		deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download release main
deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download current main
		...you should change them to this:
		deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download 10.3/release main
deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download 10.3/current main
		We are working on updating the repository to make sure that even
		if you update you don't get the broken code, and to
repair dselect, but in the meantime,
		make sure your sources.list file has the correct entries.
Other users have experienced problems with dselect itself, particularly
complaints about a missing "darwin" package.  If you are running dselect
under 10.3 and you don't get this warning, then your 
sources.list file is likely to be corrupted and you should
repair it as above.
