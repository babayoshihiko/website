  <p>
  fink-0.36.4 was released on 6 April, 2014.
  This fink release restores the use of an official binary distribution by
  default on 10.8 and 10.9 (if distributions are created for 10.6 and 10.7
  those will be supported, too).  In addition, it works around the multiple
  build failures introduced by Xcode 5.1 on 10.8 and 10.9. This release also includes 
  official support for OS X 10.9.2, fixes the bootstrap operation when Xcode.app isn't
  present, and makes x86_64 the default architecture for 10.6 bootstraps.
  </p>
  <p>Users are encouraged to run fink selfupdate to install this version of
  fink, particularly in view of the Xcode 5.1 build issues.</p>

  fink-0.36.1 was released on 17 November, 2013.
  This release fixes an intermittent bug in building Perl modules
  which was introduced with fink-0.36.0.  We encourage our users to
  install fink-0.36.1 to rectify this issue, and if you are having
  problems with installing a Perl module, use fink rebuild
  on it.
  </p>
  <p>
  In addition, the bootstrap  script now validates whether the Mavericks 
  command-line build tools are installed on that OS version, and prevents 
  folks from bootstrapping with the wrong tools.

      <description>
		<![CDATA[
	
   <p>Mountain Lion is now available to the general public.  Ideally, users should update
 to fink-0.34.0 or later before updating their OS.  In addition, Xcode 4.4 
 (or at least its command line tools) is required--it can be installed under Lion, but 
 there is a separate version of the Command Line Tools for Mountain Lion, so make sure
 to install those.  Use </p><p>fink list xcode</p><p>to verify that you have the
 Xcode 4.4 command-line tools installed, and that Fink knows where your Xcode.app is.
 If the CLI tools are missing or not for Xcode 4.4, reinstall them, e.g. via the Xcode 
 Preferences.  If fink isn't finding your Xcode.app, use</p>
 <p>sudo xcode-select -switch /path/to/Xcode.app</p>
 <p>to make sure that your system's tools are pointing to the right place.  Also run</p>
 <p>sudo xcodebuild -license</p><p>to make sure that the Xcode license is accepted
 globally on your system, especially for fink's build user.</p>
 <p>Once you have updated the OS, use</p>
 <p>fink reinstall fink</p><p>to point it to the 10.8 distribution, and run</p>
 <p>fink install perl5123-core</p><p>to make sure any Perl modules you have
 from Lion will still work.</p>
 <p>If you updated the OS first,
  and have an earlier version of fink which doesn't know about Mountain Lion, you
  have probably found that it doesn't work.  To work around this issue, do the 
  following: (1) download an updated copy of 
  <a href="https://raw.github.com/fink/fink/master/perlmod/Fink/Services.pm">
  Services.pm</a>, (2) move the downloaded file into /sw/lib/perl5/Fink, such as

   <p>Mountain Lion is now available to the general public.  Ideally, users should update
 to fink-0.34.0 or later before updating their OS.  In addition, Xcode 4.4 
 (or at least its command line tools) is required--it can be installed under Lion, but 
 there is a separate version of the Command Line Tools for Mountain Lion, so make sure
 to install those.  Use </p><p>fink list xcode</p><p>to verify that you have the
 Xcode 4.4 command-line tools installed, and that Fink knows where your Xcode.app is.
 If the CLI tools are missing or not for Xcode 4.4, reinstall them, e.g. via the Xcode 
 Preferences.  If fink isn't finding your Xcode.app, use</p>
 <p>sudo xcode-select -switch /path/to/Xcode.app</p>
 <p>to make sure that your system's tools are pointing to the right place.  Also run</p>
 <p>sudo xcodebuild -license</p><p>to make sure that the Xcode license is accepted
 globally on your system, especially for fink's build user.</p>
 <p>Once you have updated the OS, use</p>
 <p>fink reinstall fink</p><p>to point it to the 10.8 distribution, and run</p>
 <p>fink install perl5123-core</p><p>to make sure any Perl modules you have
 from Lion will still work.</p>
 <p>If you updated the OS first,
  and have an earlier version of fink which doesn't know about Mountain Lion, you
  have probably found that it doesn't work.  To work around this issue, do the 
  following: (1) download an updated copy of 
  <a href="https://raw.github.com/fink/fink/master/perlmod/Fink/Services.pm">
  Services.pm</a>, (2) move the downloaded file into /sw/lib/perl5/Fink, such as

  (change /sw and /path/to to match 
  your particular setup); (3) run</p><p>fink selfupdate</p><p>, which should
  download and install fink-0.34.0; (4) use </p><p>fink reinstall fink</p>
