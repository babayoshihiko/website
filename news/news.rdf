    <title>User Deletion Bug/ Dselect Troubles</title>
    <link>http://fink.sf.net/news/#2003-11-04%20User%20Deletion%20Bug%2F%20Dselect%20Troubles</link>
    <dc:date>2003-11-04</dc:date>
    <description>
Quick Summary: DO NOT USE DSELECT, and if you've used it,
check your /sw/etc/apt/sources.list file carefully.
		Users who have bootstrapped or installed Fink 0.5.3 or Fink 0.6.0
		on Mac OS X 10.3 could exhibit a problem where all users get deleted
		from the netinfo database, and you become unable to log in.
We believe that this problem can only occur if you've used dselect.
		If you are using Mac OS X 10.3, please be sure you're using the
		latest Fink version to avoid the issue.  To make sure you don't have
		upgrade problems, check your /sw/etc/apt/sources.list
		file.  You will need to modify it if it contains deb
		lines that point to &quot;release&quot; or &quot;current&quot; without a version number.
		In other words, if your sources.list file contains
		these lines:
		deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download release main
deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download current main
		...you should change them to this:
		deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download 10.3/release main
deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download 10.3/current main
		We are working on updating the repository to make sure that even
		if you update you don't get the broken code, and to
repair dselect, but in the meantime,
		make sure your sources.list file has the correct entries.
Other users have experienced problems with dselect itself, particularly
complaints about a missing &quot;darwin&quot; package.  If you are running dselect
under 10.3 and you don't get this warning, then your 
sources.list file is likely to be corrupted and you should
repair it as above.

    <title>Fink 0.6.1 released</title>
    <link>http://fink.sf.net/news/#2003-11-01%20Fink%200.6.1%20released</link>
    <dc:date>2003-11-01</dc:date>
    <description>
        The latest Fink release, version 0.6.1, is now available
for both source and binary users.  This release was built on OS X 10.2
using the gcc 3.3 compiler, and runs well on OS X 10.3.  Most Fink
users who upgrade to 10.3 will want to only use the binaries from this
new distribution for now, while the Fink team continues to modify
Fink packages for 10.3.

If you wish to access the 
new binaries, use apt-get, dselect, or the binary mode of
FinkCommander.  Unless you are interested in helping the Fink team
to test packages which are compiled on 10.3, 
do not use the command-line fink program to do your
installations for the
next few weeks.

The simplest way to upgrade a binary installation is to run
&quot;sudo apt-get update&quot;.  Further details and
other issues related to upgrading Fink to 10.3 are addressed on the
Special 10.3 upgrade page.

Before using the latest version of
the command-line fink program 
under OS X 10.2, be sure to install the August2003gccUpdater, available
after free registration from connect.apple.com.

		We wish all of you a happy Halloween.
		
		
		Furthermore I would like to welcome our new mirrors to the Fink family.
		From Europe in Rijeka, Croatia a new full mirror joins us. This mirrors 
		has been sponsored by the Jabucnjak Apple user group. 
		This is our first mirror in Europe, so I hope that more will be joining us 
		soon.
		
		
		Dave Schroeder from the University of 
		Wisconsin in Madison is sponsoring a 100Mbit dedicated Master server.
		A. J. Wright and SunSITE@UTK are helping out with 
		another full mirror in the United states. 
		
		
		This raises our full mirror count to four and the rsync mirror count to 
		five. We are happy to have such a great community back us up, but I know 
		that more mirrors will join over time. I will not stop nagging you until
		Fink has its own mirror in every state of the USA. Yet, with such a 
		brilliant community backing us up, I am not too worried about not
		reaching my goal very soon.
		
		
		Trick or treat! Our most wanted treat is more mirrors, so come forth 
		Administrators and fill our bag. Information on how you can be a mirror
		can be found on the official 
		mirroring website.

	As you surely noticed, Fink has a logo. This is the result of our

	This new, official, logo has been displayed since the 24th of October and

	The longer explanation also features a larger version of the logo itself,
	so that you may have a closer look at its details. We like our new logo,
	we hope that you will like it too.
	
	IMPORTANT: We do not yet have a formal licensing agreement for the new
   logo and so are unable to give permission to distribute it.  Currently, it
   can only be displayed on the Fink web page.  Thank you for your understanding.

    <title>Upgrade to gcc 3.3 and/or 10.3</title>
    <link>http://fink.sf.net/news/#2003-10-24%20Upgrade%20to%20gcc%203.3%20and%2For%2010.3</link>
    <dc:date>2003-10-24</dc:date>
    <description>
	It is now possible to upgrade Fink to take full advantage of the gcc 3.3
compiler, or to use OS X 10.3 if you have that installed.  Binary packages
corresponding to these upgrades are not yet available, so if you make 
extensive use of binary packages you may wish to wait a few days before 
upgrading.

If you wish to perform this upgrade, and you had previously installed the
June 2003 Developer Tools update from Apple, you will need to install
the August 2003 Developer Tools update BEFORE you upgrade Fink.  Under
10.3, be sure to install XCode from the XCode disk before upgrading
Fink.

Running &quot;fink selfupdate&quot; should perform the upgrade for you.  The latest
version of the fink package manager will automatically detect which
version of OS X and which version of gcc you have installed, and will
adjust itself accordingly.

If you wish to do a fresh install of Fink on a 10.3 system, we recommend
bootstrapping from
source, starting from fink-full-0.6.0.tar.gz available
on fink's sourceforge 
download page.  You'll need XCode for this as
well.

Also note that once you have Fink version 0.15.0 or higher, you do
not need to install system-xfree86 anymore.  Fink is
capable of automatically determining your system-xfree86 version if you
don't already have any fink x11 packages installed.  If you currently
have an old system-xfree86 package of any kind installed, please run the
following:

sudo dpkg -r --force-all system-xfree86 system-xfree86-42 \
system-xfree86-43; fink selfupdate; fink index

The Fink team is still working on getting Fink packages working under 10.3,
but many many packages already work.

The latest version of the fink package manager offers a new update
method, fink selfupdate-rsync, as an alternative to the
CVS updates which have been so problematic in the past few months.
If you have difficulty updating to the new version, please follow
these 
special update instructions.

In addition, this version of the fink package manager is compatible
with last summer's Developer Tools updates.  After installing both the new
package manager and the Developer Tools update, 
fink will ask you to reset your gcc version whenever
that is necessary.

As announced in this CERT 
advisory, it has recently been discovered that
the ftp servers for GNU software were compromised back in March, 
although it is not believed that any of the source code housed there
was affected.

Fink relies on MD5 checksums when downloading software, and we have had
no reports of incorrect checksums in Fink packages.  The Free Software
Foundation is in the process of verifying the integrity of all of the
source code distributed from that ftp site.  As of this writing, the source
code for the following Fink packages have not yet been verified:
autoconf2.54,
emacs21,
gprolog,
groff,
guile16,
help2man,
jwhois,
libtool14,
libosip1,
sed,
slib.
It may be difficult to install those packages at present.

    <dc:date>2003-06-26</dc:date>
    <description>
Quick Summary: DO NOT INSTALL THIS UPDATE.
               
Apple has released a patch to the December 2002 
Developer Tools which includes gcc 3.3,
their new compiler.

Fink does not yet support compiling with gcc 3.3.  In addition, it is important
not to &quot;mix and match&quot; between compilers:  all C++ code in fink packages
needs to be compiled
with the same compiler.

For this reason, the Fink team recommends that if you update your
Developer Tools with the new patch, you should be careful to run
sudo gcc_select 3
prior to any &quot;fink build&quot; or &quot;fink install&quot; commands.

Update 30 June 2003: A 
problem
has now been detected with
the new assembler program which the update installs, which may prevent
certain Fink packages from being compiled at all if you install this
update.  

Generally, Fortran programs will break if you install the update;
the breakage does not stop by simply switching back to gcc 3.1.
The Fink team is working on a workaround for this problem, but until it
is ready, if you need Fortran-related programs you should not install
the update.

	While Apple's X11 works just fine with existing binaries, it
has a bug in the install name of the libraries that can cause some
software to build incorrectly, and will break forward-compatibility
with future X11 releases.


	Ben Hines has created a script (available here) that you can use
that will fix the install_name entries in Apple's X11 libraries,
but it will not repair software you have already built against the
broken libraries.

Update 11 February 2003: This script is not needed with 
version 0.2 of Apple's X11.app which was released yesterday.

        A problem was uncovered today concerning the versions of imlib,
 libpng, and gnome in Fink's unstable tree.  The Fink team is hard at
 work addressing this problem.  As a workaround, users can downgrade
their imlib package to the stable version, &quot;fink install
 imlib-1.9.10-9&quot;, until the problem is fixed.

   Many Fink users may be using Fink's unstable tree without being
fully aware of what this entails.  For a few months in the fall,
enabling the unstable tree was the only way to gain access to
 10.2-compatible versions of Fink packages.  
That is no longer the case.
Fink users who do not wish to help the Fink team with testing should
disable their unstable tree.  To do this, edit the file
/sw/etc/fink.conf and remove the items
 unstable/main and unstable/crypto from the
 Trees line.
	
The Fink team appreciates those users who are willing to stick with
the unstable tree, even when there are problems like today's, and provide
the team with prompt feedback.  This is a community effort and we
appreciate your participation.
