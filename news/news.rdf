        The Virex 7.2 package, currently being distributed free to all .Mac 
members, has a serious conflict with Fink.  Fink users should not install 
Virex 7.2 under any circumstances.
  Installing it after Fink is installed
will damage your Fink installation; installing it prior to Fink will make
it impossible to install Fink without damaging Virex.

This bug has been reported 
to Virex's manufacturer.  We will keep the
Fink community informed about the situation as it develops.

    <description>
	
	While Apple's X11 works just fine with existing binaries, it
has a bug in the install name of the libraries that can cause some
software to build incorrectly, and will break forward-compatibility
with future X11 releases.


	Ben Hines has created a script (available here) that you can use
that will fix the install_name entries in Apple's X11 libraries,
but it will not repair software you have already built against the
broken libraries.

Update 11 February 2003: This script is not needed with 
version 0.2 of Apple's X11.app which was released yesterday.

    <description>
	
        A problem was uncovered today concerning the versions of imlib,
 libpng, and gnome in Fink's unstable tree.  The Fink team is hard at
 work addressing this problem.  As a workaround, users can downgrade
their imlib package to the stable version, &quot;fink install
 imlib-1.9.10-9&quot;, until the problem is fixed.

   Many Fink users may be using Fink's unstable tree without being
fully aware of what this entails.  For a few months in the fall,
enabling the unstable tree was the only way to gain access to
 10.2-compatible versions of Fink packages.  
That is no longer the case.
Fink users who do not wish to help the Fink team with testing should
disable their unstable tree.  To do this, edit the file
/sw/etc/fink.conf and remove the items
 unstable/main and unstable/crypto from the
 Trees line.
	
The Fink team appreciates those users who are willing to stick with
the unstable tree, even when there are problems like today's, and provide
the team with prompt feedback.  This is a community effort and we
appreciate your participation.

      The source release and the binary installer are available now, as well as all binary packages. For information about upgrading, visit the Upgrade Matrix.

    <description>
  
  Users are cautioned to use the binary installer for Fink 0.4.1 only
once on a given machine.  Due to an apparent bug in Apple's
Installer.app program, attempting a second installation on the same
machine can result in permissions being altered in the machine's root
directory, in some cases leaving the machine in a non-bootable state.
 If Installer.app presents you with an &quot;Upgrade&quot; button rather
than an &quot;Install&quot; button when installing Fink 0.4.1, do not proceed
any further! 
A new version of the binary installer for Fink 0.4.1 became available
on November 5.  The new version avoids
the problem of the machine not booting, but even with the new version,
users are advised to only &quot;Install&quot;,
not &quot;Upgrade.&quot;  (You can recognize the new version by its filesize of
12582912 bytes, while the old version had a filesize of 10541112 bytes.)

			At the moment, approximately 800 out of 1150 Fink packages have been made ready for 10.2. However, virtually all of these packages are still being tested and have not yet been moved to the &quot;stable&quot; tree in the 10.2 section; moreover, binaries for 10.2 packages are not yet available.

      During the last few weeks, we got a lot of emails asking whether Fink will work Mac OS X 10.2.
    
    
      The answer is: Yes, we will support 10.2. However, due to some
      major changes in this new OS version, we had to make a lot of adjustments both
      to the Fink tool itself and to many packages. The current binary distribution,
      0.4.0a, will only work partially on 10.2. We are working on an upgrade guide,
      as well as a new Fink release, to support 10.2.
    
	
	 If you upgrade your system to 10.2 before the official Fink update for 10.2 is ready,
	 many Fink packages built on 10.1 are going to work fine, but others need to be rebuilt.
	 Some packages need special changes to build on 10.2. Adding &quot;unstable/main&quot; to your
	 list of trees in /sw/etc/fink.conf (see also the FAQ)
	 will give you access to the latest versions of packages, many of which include important
	 fixes for 10.2.
	
    
     As of now, please do not email us asking about 10.2 support. If you can't wait,
     consult the mailing list archives instead.

    <dc:date>2002-05-03</dc:date>
    <description>
    
      All Fink users are urged to update their  passwd  package to version 20020329 or newer. Older versions of the  passwd  package are affected by a bug which could lead to the loss of all data on your hard disk if you remove system users created by Fink manually from the system via System Preferences. (Removing them via the NetInfo tool is safe.) You can check the version of your passwd package by entering  dpkg -s passwd. If your version is oudated, you can update to the current one in two ways: 
    
    
      
        Via the binary distribution. First make sure you have the latest list of packages available:  sudo apt-get update. Then you can perform the actual update:  sudo apt-get install passwd. 
      
      
        Via the source distribution. First make sure you have the latest set of package descriptions:  fink selfupdate-cvs. Then, update the passwd package:  fink update passwd 
      
    
    
      See Fink's FAQ, question 6.3, for more information about the passwd package.
