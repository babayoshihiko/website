      <p>Version 0.29.19 of the fink package manager has just been
      released to the unstable tree.  This version of fink         
      features more verbose output from 'fink --version' for debugging purposes,

      on 10.6.6, however.)</p>
      <p>It is expected that this version will migrate to the stable tree soon,
      provided that there are no reports of bad behavior from unstable tree     
      users.</p>

      <p>We are experiencing a temporary failure in some of the rsync mirrors.
      If you have not seen updates in a while, then you may wish to change your
      rsync mirror for the time being by editing /sw/etc/fink.conf as a superuser
      and replacing the line that starts with Mirror-rsync with
        Mirror-rsync: rsync://fink.gecko.ig42.org/finkinfo/</p>
        <p>or</p><p>

         <p>or</p><p>
        Mirror-rsync: rsync://ams.nl.eu.finkmirrors.net/finkinfo/</p>       
      <p>If you prefer, you can select the latter three of the above mirrors via fink configure
      as well:  choose Asia (option 2) as your continent, Japan (10) as your country,
      and rsync://distfiles.hnd.jp.asi.finkmirrors.net/finkinfo/ (2) as the Rsync Selfupdate mirror;
      or choose Europe (4), then Germany (13) and rsync://ber.de.eu.finkmirrors.net/finkinfo/

      <p>The Fink project was started in the waning days of December 2000 by
Christoph Pfisterer, using the "public beta" release of Mac OS X.
Within a year, versions 10.0 and 10.1 of OS X had been released, and
Fink usage took off.  Our founder chrisp stepped away from the project
in November 2001, and the community took over.</p>
<p>The Fink community is the heart of Fink, involving both package maintainers
and Fink users, as well as the small core team which tries to keep the
overall system in good shape.  The success of this community in keeping
Fink viable and active over ten years is really quite remarkable!  Let's
all join together to keep Fink going for a long time to come.</p>
<p>How long?  In the memorable words of Buzz Lightyear: To Infinity
and Beyond!</p>

      <p>We have had server issues and as a result the Web site and the
      official binary distribution are down, and the rsync servers are stalled.
      Whilst we sort this out, you may:</p>
      
        (Web site) Use <a href="http://fink.thetis.ig42.org">http://fink.thetis.ig42.org</a> if
        you need Web site information

        (selfupdate) If you use rsync as your selfupdate method then edit
        /sw/etc/fink.conf and replace the line that starts with
        Mirror-rsync with Mirror-rsync:
        rsync://fink.gecko.ig42.org/finkinfo/

        (source files) Edit /sw/etc/fink.conf and replace the
        line that starts with Mirror-master with
        Mirror-master: http://fink-dist.gecko.ig42.org
        
        (bindist) Edit /sw/etc/fink.conf and replace the line

Fink is ready to be used on Snow Leopard (OS X v. 10.6).  Users will
need to choose between a 32-bit version of fink and a 64-bit version of fink
for 10.6.
The 32-bit version has more packages available at the present time, but
the 64-bit version represents the future direction for OS X and for fink;
individual users must make this decision on their own.  It will not
be possible to "upgrade" from 32-bit to 64-bit (or vice versa), without
completely reinstalling fink.
</p><p>
At the moment, two methods are available for installing Fink on Snow Leopard.
A binary installer is not available, so it is important to
first install XCode from the Optional Installs folder on the Snow
Leopard disk.
Users wanting the 64-bit version, or users upgrading directly from 10.4 or
earlier, must bootstrap fink from the distribution tarball (version
0.29.9 or later), available at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fink/files/fink/0.29.9/fink-0.29.9.tar.gz/download">sourceforge.net</a>; installation instructions are
<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/srcdist.php">here</a>.
On the other hand, users can upgrade directly from
10.5 to the 32-bit version, following the instructions below.
(One warning: users who have installed a development version of fink
from CVS rather than a released version may encounter trouble; please
downgrade your fink to a released version, and remove stray .deb files
of higher versions, before beginning.)
</p><p>
To upgrade, follow a four step process.
Step 1: edit the file /sw/etc/fink.conf,
adding a line to it which reads NoAutoIndex: true  (You may
need to use sudo to obtain the correct permissions to edit
this file.)  Step 2: 
run the command fink reinstall fink in
order to tell fink that you are now on 10.6.  (If you encounter a message
about package database corruption, run fink index -f and
try this step again.)  Step 3: 
run the command fink update
fink to get the latest fink for 10.6.  Step 4: run the command
fink install perl588-core to replace the version of perl
which Apple changed during the OS X upgrade, in case you have 
fink packages which depend on it.
</p><p>After the upgrade, you may wish to run fink configure
to do some cleanup.
</p><p>Almost all of the packages in fink's stable tree will compile on
10.6, but be warned that only a fraction of the 10.5 packages are currently
available for 10.6.  In the near future, fink's package database will be
updated to include information about packages for 10.6; you can check there
to see if your favorite package is ready.

The Fink Core Group announces two new members: Alexander Hansen (akh)
and Augusto Devegili (monipol), both of whom have been very active
in fink.  Please join us in welcoming the new members!
</p><p>
The Group also announces that Christian Schaffner has stepped down,
returning to "ordinary member" status.  We thank Christian for his help
on the team over the past several years.
</p><p>
Members of the Fink project are working hard to provide user support,
to keep Fink up to date, and to prepare for the upcoming Snow Leopard
release.  More volunteers are always needed, so please consider
getting involved at some level!
