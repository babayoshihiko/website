The Fink team has received reports of problems with the rsync
program which was modified by Apple's new Security Update 2006-001: for some
users, fink selfupdate fails to function after the Security
Update.  (The underlying cause appears to be a problem with the 
--delete option for rsync.)


As a workaround, users can run fink install rsync to use
fink's rsync package rather than the Apple program.  Or, for those users
who need specific features of the Apple program (such as support for
Extended Attributes), another workaround is fink selfupdate-cvs
to switch from rsync to cvs updating.  


This news item will be updated as the situation changes.

A preliminary version of Fink for the Intel architecture is now ready.
No binary packages are available, and things are still rough around
the edges, but it should be usable if you are patient!


To install, you need to get the file fink-0.24.12.tar.gz
from the
Sourceforge file release page for Fink, expand the file, and
run the command ./bootstrap.sh .  At the end of the
bootstrap process, run fink selfupdate and you'll get
the currently available packages.


At last check, there were about 1750 packages in the "stable" tree, but
about 150 of those did not build.  When things are truly stable, another
annoucement will be made here.

Fink is now ready for XCode 2.2, with the exception of the openoffice.org 
packages (which are expected to function again when we switch to the 10.4
tree).  Users are encouraged to upgrade to XCode 2.2 whenever they wish;
XCode 2.2 will be required for running the 10.4 tree when it is released.


On the other hand, in spite of today's announcements from Apple, Fink is
not ready to run on Intel processors.  The Fink team hopes to have an
Intel-ready version of fink released within a few weeks; the Fink team does 
not advise early recipients of new iMacs to install Fink on them, but suggests
waiting until the new version of fink is ready.

Fink package maintainers please take note of the new Architecture field, now documented in the packaging manual.

The Fink team has had reports of some build problems with the XCode 2.2 compilers.  Until these are sorted out, we recommend that users hold off on upgrading XCode.


For those who have already installed XCode 2.2 and don't want to revert to 2.1, your participation in the effort to find packages that don't work and to fix them so that they do is welcomed!

Three new Fink releases are 
available
 today: version 0.8.0 (for 10.4),
version 0.7.2 (for 10.3), and version 0.6.4 (for 10.2).
All three releases include source files, binary packages, and a Fink
installer for new users.


The new release for 10.4 includes all currently-available "stable" packages
in source and binary form: there are 1565 of these, which constitutes more
than 80% of the 1909 packages available in the 10.3 release.  Work continues
by the fink developers on bringing more of the stable packages to Tiger.


The new release for 10.2 will be the last official release for that
version of Mac OS X.  Although no further updates (not even security
updates) will be provided by the Fink team, we anticipate that the
0.6.4 release will be usable for years to come.


Users upgrading to 10.4 can now simply issue a 
fink selfupdate command, followed by
sudo /sw/lib/fink/postinstall.pl (for first-time updaters
on 10.4), fink scanpackages and sudo apt-get update.
We don't recommend bootstrapping at the moment, since bootstrapping does
not work with the newly-released XCode 2.1 from Apple.


Note added 6/19/05: If the Fink-0.8.0 binary installer complains that the
volume does not support symlinks, try launching Disk Utility (from the 
Utilities folder inside the Applications folder), selecting the 
problematic volume and clicking on "repair disk permissions."  Also, the installer requires you to have administrative privileges, so be sure that you're running it as such a user.

Note added 6/30/05:  To avoid contamination with obsolete headers and the like, we recommend that people who want to build packages from source should perform a clean install of XCode via running the /Developer/Tools/uninstall-devtools.pl script.  For best results, you may want to do this before updating your OS.

Fink can be used on OS X 10.4!  There are several ways you can update:


A binary installer will be available within a few weeks, for binary-only
users.  In the meantime, new users should bootstrap fink 0.23.10, just
as stable users, below.

For users of the stable tree, we recommend that you delete your current
fink with sudo rm -Rf /sw and then "bootstrap" an
installation of fink-0.23.10 using

fink-0.23.10.tar.gz--download that file and expand it, 
eg. via
tar -xvzf fink-0.23.10.tar.gz.  After running the command
 ./bootstrap.sh  in the resulting
fink-0.23.10 directory,
you'll need to run fink selfupdate

For users of the unstable tree, you may be able to upgrade just by running 
fink selfupdate if your version of fink is less than 0.24.6.  
It will install fink-0.24.6 for you.  After upgrading to 10.4, first check 
that you have the right version of fink by issuing fink --version
.  If your version is less than 0.24.6, run fink selfupdate to 
get the right version of fink.  Then, whether you selfupdated or not, 
reinstall the fink package using fink rebuild fink, 
and follow that with another fink selfupdate.


Not all packages are working yet under 10.4, but that situation will
improve over the next several weeks.  The stable tree contains substantially
fewer packages than in 10.3, but all of them should compile.

Of course, some wrinkles still need to be ironed out.  We encourage 
users with mission-critical applications to check in on the mailing 
lists to verify whether anyone has had experience with the package in 
question before upgrading.

Apple has released the November 2004 gcc3 updater, available (upon free 
registration) at connect.apple.com.  This updater fixes the problems with
the gcc3 compiler in XCode 1.5.  If you are using XCode 1.5, you should 
install this updater.  (The updater will update correctly for users with
an untouched XCode 1.5, and also for users who installed the workaround which
the fink project had previously recommended.)

We would like to thank Apple for responding to our reports about this
matter, and working to resolve it as quickly as possible.

The version of gcc included with XCode 1.5 is known to produce 
incorrect output from c++ code under certain circumstances.
Fink now has a mechanism to warn users about this, and Fink will soon
refuse
to use the "broken" gcc to compile packages which are known to
have this problem.

If you have already upgraded XCode to version 1.5, there is a workaround,
described  here 
and  here .
 If you have not yet upgraded, you should consider remaining with
XCode version 1.2 until the problem has been resolved.

The latest Fink release, version 0.7.1 (for 10.3),
is now available for both source and binary users. This release is meant for Panther (10.3)  based
Mac OS X versions.  The 0.6.3 release remains available for Jaguar (10.2) based Mac OS X versions. 



This new release incorporates various fixes to the package manager, 
and many previously
unavailable binary packages have been added resulting in a total of 1650 binary packages. This includes
binaries for KDE 3.1.4 and GNOME 2.4.



To complete a new Fink installation you should follow the instructions posted
here.
You may upgrade your existing Fink to the latest Fink using your current installation.

A full list of the differences between 0.7.0 and 0.7.1 can be viewed by visiting this

page.



If you have questions or problems, please try the Fink mailing lists.  You can learn more about them
here.



Please make sure you pick the appropriate installer for your platform.
Fink 0.6.3 will only install on Mac OS X 10.2.*, while Fink 0.7.1 will only install on Mac OS X 10.3.*


        
The Fink Team would like to thank its many contributors, frequent helpers
and developers for making this release happen.
We also thank our community for downloading the prior release 0.7.0 more than 130,000 times. 
Without their constant support and valuable pointers, Fink would not be where we are now.

	If for any reason those commands don't work, go to 
	the 
	fink file release page at sourceforge and download the
	file fink-0.22.1.tar.gz (or a more recent, i.e.,
	higher numbered, version).  Unpack this file with
	tar xfz fink-0.22.1.tar.gz , and then from within the
	fink-0.22.1 directory, run the command ./inject.pl
	
	
	The fink team apologizes for the error, and thanks the user 
	community for bringing it to our attention quickly.

	Fink's decision to gradually build its own network of mirrors
	has paid off. To make sure that we can continue to offer
	a high quality service we need to improve our mirror network.
	It has been some time since we last asked for more mirrors. 
	It is time to do so again. Fink is very grateful for the resources 
	granted to us by our community. To further improve our service to the 
	community we require an even better mirror system. We especially lack 
	mirrors in central Europe, Russia and the Far East. If you feel that 
	you have at least two Mbit to spare for a rsync mirror, or more to offer 
	a distfiles mirror, please contact us.
	
	
	 To get a better understanding of the different types of mirrors 
	 Fink offers, please review finkmirrors.net. This is the official homepage for all mirror related issues.
	 If you feel that you can offer other types of resources, 
	 web-space for testing as an example, please do not hesitate in contacting us as well.

Thanks to Baba Yoshihiko, Fink has now taken the necessary steps to allow for 
internationalisation efforts. 
The improved infrastructure enables us to display a multilingual web-site to our visitors from all over the world. 


This also means that we need volunteers. The Fink web-site needs to be translated into the language of your choice. 
A translation into Japanese is being worked on and the translation into French has been taken over by Michele Garoche. 
Which language are you willing to translate?


If you are willing to become a member of the internationalisation team or wish to provide feedback on 
the web-site feel free to join the new mailing-list.
You can do so by going to our mailing-lists page. The full announcement on the existing 
mailing lists can be read here.

If you previously had Java 1.4.1 and the Java SDK installed, the new
Java 1.4.2 update from apple will upgrade the Java runtime to 1.4.2,
but will remove the previous 1.4.1 Java runtime and
SDK without upgrading the JDK.  To build Java packages in Fink
you will need to go to
connect.apple.com and download the Java 1.4.2 SDK (free
registration required).
