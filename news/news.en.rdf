Fink users on PowerPC machines are advised to update their copies of
fink from the old "10.4-transitional" tree to the more recent "10.4"
tree.  We plan to discontinue the 10.4-transitional tree
by the end of July, 2006.
</p><p>
Some background: along with OS X 10.4 came a new version of the g++ compiler
(one of the workhorses of Fink), which produced code that was binary
incompatible with previous versions.  Fink, when using the 10.4-transitional 
tree, mixes the new gcc-4.0 compiler with the older g++-3.3 compiler.
This strategy gave us some extra time to make packages compatible with
g++-4.0.  The time has now come to complete that transition, and rely
exclusively on the newer tree.  The update, however, is slightly
complicated since all packages using or providing g++ libraries must
be rebuilt in the correct order.
</p><p>
If you are using OS X 10.4, you can
find out if you need to update your Fink installation
by running the command
fink --version.  If the Distribution version is 0.8.1.cvs
or 0.8.1.rsync, you do not need to update.  However, if the 
Distribution version is 0.8.0.cvs or 0.8.0.rsync, you should update,
as described below.
</p>
<p>
Many users will prefer to remove their fink installations and
start anew with the 0.8.1 installer.  Others will prefer to use the 
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/fink/scripts-10.4-update-0.3.tar.gz?download">10.4-update 
tarball (v. 0.3)</a> (around 12 MB), which includes 
precompiled versions of the basic fink packages as well as a script which
will attempt to update an existing fink installation.  Please consult
the README file which you will find within the 10.4-update directory 
(after unpacking the tarball) for further instructions.

A new Fink release for OS X 10.4 (Tiger) is 
<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/index.php">available</a>
 today: version 0.8.1, which can be installed on either Intel or PowerPC
hardware.
The release includes source files, binary packages, and  Fink
installers for both kinds of hardware.
</p>
      <p>
Fink on the Intel platform is still considered "beta" quality, and a number of
packages (particularly packages in the "unstable" tree) either do not compile,
or compile but do not run.  Work to improve this situation is ongoing.
</p>
<p>
Fink users on PowerPC whose existing fink installation uses the 
10.4-transitional tree (from the 0.8.0 distribution) may upgrade in
one of two ways.  The upgrade process is problematic, due to the change
in ABI of g++ libraries which requires many libraries to be recompiled.
Many users will simply wish to remove their fink installations and
start anew with the 0.8.1 installer.  Others may wish to use the new
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/fink/scripts-10.4-update-0.3.tar.gz?download">10.4-update tarball (v. 0.3)</a> (around 12 MB), which includes

      <p>
As many Fink users are aware, the Fink CVS repository at sourceforge.net
has not been fully functional since March 30.  The anonymous CVS access
has not been updated since then, and as of several days ago, the developers
are also unable to update CVS in any form.
</p><p>
As we understand the current plans of sourceforge's staff (outlined
briefly on their <a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=2352&amp;group_id=1">site
status page</a>), the old CVS servers will never be brought back in
their current form.  This is likely to mean disruption for fink users,
but at present, we cannot say what form this disruption will take.
</p><p>
Our current advice to fink users is to switch to the 'rsync' method of
updating (by running the command 'fink selfupdate-rsync').  This will at
least give you a fink installation which is current up through May 7.
If a full update to the new CVS situation turns out to be impossible
via fink's normal selfupdate command, we will post instructions here
on how to update when they become available.
</p>
<p>Update 5/24/06: CVS is now functioning again, and users using the rsync
method of selfupdating are getting up-to-date content.  If you are using
the cvs method, and can't (or don't wish to) switch to rsync, you should
download the file fink-mirrors-0.24.15.2.tar.gz from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203&amp;package_id=69685">the
Sourceforge file release page</a>, expand the file, and run the command
./inject.pl from within the fink-mirrors-0.24.15.2 directory.  After this has been done, the fink selfupdate command
should again work normally.

      <p>
The Fink team has received reports of problems with the rsync
program which was modified by Apple's new Security Update 2006-001: for some
users, fink selfupdate fails to function after the Security
Update.  (The underlying cause appears to be a problem with the 
--delete option for rsync.)
</p>
      <p>
As a workaround, users can run fink install rsync to use
fink's rsync package rather than the Apple program.  Or, for those users
who need specific features of the Apple program (such as support for
Extended Attributes), another workaround is fink selfupdate-cvs
to switch from rsync to cvs updating.  
</p>
<p>Update 3/13/06: This has been resolved by security update 2006-002,
<a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303453">according
to Apple's documentation</a>.

A preliminary version of Fink for the Intel architecture is now ready.
No binary packages are available, and things are still rough around
the edges, but it should be usable if you are patient!
</p>
      <p>
To install it, you need to install the XCode compiler and SDK packages (at minimum).  Then you need to get the file
fink-0.24.16.tar.gz (or a later version, if it's available)
from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203&amp;package_id=13043">the
Sourceforge file release page for Fink</a>, expand the file, and
run the command ./bootstrap.sh .  At the end of the
bootstrap process, run fink selfupdate and you'll get
the currently available packages.
</p>
      <p>
At last check, there were about 1750 packages in the "stable" tree, but
about 150 of those did not build.  When things are truly stable, another
annoucement will be made here.

Fink is now ready for XCode 2.2, with the exception of the openoffice.org 
packages (which are expected to function again when we switch to the 10.4
tree).  Users are encouraged to upgrade to XCode 2.2 whenever they wish;
XCode 2.2 will be required for running the 10.4 tree when it is released.
</p>
      <p>
On the other hand, in spite of today's announcements from Apple, Fink is
not ready to run on Intel processors.  The Fink team hopes to have an
Intel-ready version of fink released within a few weeks; the Fink team does 
not advise early recipients of new iMacs to install Fink on them, but suggests
waiting until the new version of fink is ready.
</p>
      <p>Fink package maintainers please take note of the new Architecture field, now documented in the packaging manual.

      <p>
Three new Fink releases are 
<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/index.php">available</a>
 today: version 0.8.0 (for 10.4),
version 0.7.2 (for 10.3), and version 0.6.4 (for 10.2).
All three releases include source files, binary packages, and a Fink
installer for new users.
</p>
      <p>
The new release for 10.4 includes all currently-available "stable" packages
in source and binary form: there are 1565 of these, which constitutes more
than 80% of the 1909 packages available in the 10.3 release.  Work continues
by the fink developers on bringing more of the stable packages to Tiger.
</p>
      <p>
The new release for 10.2 will be the last official release for that
version of Mac OS X.  Although no further updates (not even security
updates) will be provided by the Fink team, we anticipate that the
0.6.4 release will be usable for years to come.
</p>
      <p>
Users upgrading to 10.4 can now simply issue a 
fink selfupdate command, followed by
sudo /sw/lib/fink/postinstall.pl (for first-time updaters
on 10.4), fink scanpackages and sudo apt-get update.
We don't recommend bootstrapping at the moment, since bootstrapping does
not work with the newly-released XCode 2.1 from Apple.
</p>
      <p>
Note added 6/19/05: If the Fink-0.8.0 binary installer complains that the
volume does not support symlinks, try launching Disk Utility (from the 
Utilities folder inside the Applications folder), selecting the 
problematic volume and clicking on "repair disk permissions."  Also, the installer requires you to have administrative privileges, so be sure that you're running it as such a user.
</p>
      <p>Note added 6/30/05:  To avoid contamination with obsolete headers and the like, we recommend that people who want to build packages from source should perform a clean install of XCode via running the /Developer/Tools/uninstall-devtools.pl script.  For best results, you may want to do this before updating your OS.</p>

For best results, you may want to do this before updating your OS.</p>

Fink can be used on OS X 10.4!  There are several ways you can update:
</p>
      
        
A binary installer will be available within a few weeks, for binary-only
users.  In the meantime, new users should bootstrap fink 0.23.10, just
as stable users, below.

        
For users of the stable tree, we recommend that you delete your current
fink with sudo rm -Rf /sw and then "bootstrap" an
installation of fink-0.23.10 using
<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203&amp;package_id=13043&amp;release_id=326600">
fink-0.23.10.tar.gz</a>--download that file and expand it, 
eg. via
tar -xvzf fink-0.23.10.tar.gz.  After running the command
 ./bootstrap.sh  in the resulting
fink-0.23.10 directory,
you'll need to run fink selfupdate

        
For users of the unstable tree, you may be able to upgrade just by running 
fink selfupdate if your version of fink is less than 0.24.6.  
It will install fink-0.24.6 for you.  After upgrading to 10.4, first check 
that you have the right version of fink by issuing fink --version
.  If your version is less than 0.24.6, run fink selfupdate to 
get the right version of fink.  Then, whether you selfupdated or not, 
reinstall the fink package using fink rebuild fink, 
and follow that with another fink selfupdate.

      
      <p>Not all packages are working yet under 10.4, but that situation will
improve over the next several weeks.  The stable tree contains substantially
fewer packages than in 10.3, but all of them should compile.
</p>
      <p>Of course, some wrinkles still need to be ironed out.  We encourage 
users with mission-critical applications to check in on the mailing 
lists to verify whether anyone has had experience with the package in 
question before upgrading.</p>

Apple has released the November 2004 gcc3 updater, available (upon free 
registration) at connect.apple.com.  This updater fixes the problems with
the gcc3 compiler in XCode 1.5.  If you are using XCode 1.5, you should 
install this updater.  (The updater will update correctly for users with
an untouched XCode 1.5, and also for users who installed the workaround which
the fink project had previously recommended.)
</p>
      <p>
We would like to thank Apple for responding to our reports about this
matter, and working to resolve it as quickly as possible.

The version of gcc included with XCode 1.5 is known to produce 
incorrect output from c++ code under certain circumstances.
Fink now has a mechanism to warn users about this, and Fink will soon
refuse
to use the "broken" gcc to compile packages which are known to
have this problem.
</p>
      <p>
If you have already upgraded XCode to version 1.5, there is a workaround,
described <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.os.apple.fink.beginners/13580"> here </a>
and <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.os.apple.fink.beginners/14200"> here </a>.
</p>
      <p> If you have not yet upgraded, you should consider remaining with
XCode version 1.2 until the problem has been resolved.

	In the past few days, there have been reports that some fink packages 
	do not compile correctly using XCode 1.5.  If you have not already
	upgraded to XCode 1.5, we suggest that you wait until this issue
	is resolved before doing so.
	</p>
      <p>
	If you are having problems with a package which compiled under
	XCode 1.2 but does not compile correctly under XCode 1.5, 
	please report the package to
	the fink-devel mailing list.  (The usual symptom is: some symbols
	are  missing after compiling with g++.)  
	Packages already known to have this problem include
	octave, singular-factory, singular-libfac, and possibly sdl.

	The fink-0.22.0 package manager, which was available briefly in the 
	unstable tree this past week, had a bug which prevents further
	updating via rsync.  If you installed this version of fink, you
	can recover by running the command 
	fink install fink-0.21.2-1 which will downgrade fink
	to the version in the stable tree, and subsequently running
	fink selfupdate
	</p>
      <p>
	If for any reason those commands don't work, go to 
	<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203">the 
	fink file release page at sourceforge</a> and download the
	file fink-0.22.1.tar.gz (or a more recent, i.e.,
	higher numbered, version).  Unpack this file with
	tar xfz fink-0.22.1.tar.gz , and then from within the
	fink-0.22.1 directory, run the command ./inject.pl

      <p>
	The fink team apologizes for the error, and thanks the user

	Fink's decision to gradually build its own network of mirrors
	has paid off. To make sure that we can continue to offer
	a high quality service we need to improve our mirror network.
	It has been some time since we last asked for more mirrors. 
	It is time to do so again. Fink is very grateful for the resources 
	granted to us by our community. To further improve our service to the 
	community we require an even better mirror system. We especially lack 
	mirrors in central Europe, Russia and the Far East. If you feel that 
	you have at least two Mbit to spare for a rsync mirror, or more to offer 
	a distfiles mirror, please <a href="mailto:mirrors@finkmirrors.net">contact us</a>.
	</p>
      <p>
	 To get a better understanding of the different types of mirrors 
	 Fink offers, please review <a href="http://finkmirrors.net/">finkmirrors.net</a>. This is the official homepage for all mirror related issues.
	 If you feel that you can offer other types of resources, 
	 web-space for testing as an example, please do not hesitate in <a href="mailto:mirrors@finkmirrors.net">contacting us</a> as well.
