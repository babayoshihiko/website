 The Fink Archive
==================

This directory holds the official binary distribution of Fink and the
corresponding source code. The basic structure is the same as that of
the Debian GNU/Linux archive. This is because Fink uses Debian's tools
(dpkg, apt) for binary package management.

Inside each tree (e.g. dists/current/main) there are three
directories. "binary-darwin-powerpc" contains the binary packages
(.deb files). "source" contains the corresponding original
source. "finkinfo" contains the patches and build information used to
build the packages. All three may have subdirectories denoting
sections.

You can find a graphical installer for Mac OS X in the "install"
directory. Other installation methods may follow in the future.

You are welcome to mirror this distribution as long as you follow
some rules. Detailed instructions are at
<http://fink.sourceforge.net/bindist/mirroring.php>.
