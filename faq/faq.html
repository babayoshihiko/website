<p>This is the list of frequently asked questions about Fink. Like
in most FAQs, some questions are taken from real life and some are
made up. It's really more like a documentation written in an ad-hoc,
question and answer style.</p>
<p>The FAQ consists of several pages, one for each section. All
questions are listed and linked in the table of contents below.</p>

<a name="general.what">
<div class="question"><p><b>Q1.1: What is Fink?</b></p></div>
<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> 
Fink wants to bring more Unix software to Mac OS X, which results in
two main goals:
</p><p>
Goal number one is porting software to Mac OS X.
That means we take commodity Open Source Unix software and fix
whatever is necessary so that it will compile and run on Mac OS X.
Sometimes that's easy, but it can also be very hard or even impossible
for some packages.
We're trying to provide tools and documentation to make this easier.
</p><p>
Goal number two is making the results available to casual users.
For this, we build a distribution using package management tools
ported over from Linux, namely <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">dpkg</tt> and
<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">apt-get</tt>, written by and for the <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a> project.
The binary distribution uses the <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">.deb</tt> package format.
For building packages from source, we have our own tool, named
<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink</tt>, which creates those <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">.deb</tt> package
files.
</p></div>
</a>
<a name="general.naming">
<div class="question"><p><b>Q1.2: What does the name Fink stand for?</b></p></div>
<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> Nothing, it's just a name. It's not even an acronym.</p><p>Well, actually Fink is the German name for Finch, a kind of
bird. I was looking for a name for the project, and the name of the
OS, Darwin, led me to think about Charles Darwin, the Galapagos
Islands and evolution. I remembered a piece about the so-called Darwin
Finches and their beaks from school, and well, that's it...</p></div>
</a>
<a name="general.bsd-ports">
<div class="question"><p><b>Q1.3: How is Fink different
from the BSD port mechanism (this includes OpenPackages and
GNU-Darwin)?</b></p></div>
<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> Some main advantages:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>
It's written in Perl, not make/shell.
Thus it doesn't rely on special features only found in BSD make.
There is no need to flag packages that need GNU make to build.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
dpkg provides sophisticated management for binary packages - smooth
updating, special handling for configuration files, virtual packages
and other advanced dependencies.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fink doesn't install into /usr/local unless explicitly requested and
doesn't require fiddling with /usr/bin/make or other system-provided
commands.
That makes it safer to use and reduces interference with Mac OS X and
third-party packages to a minimum.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</a>
<a name="general.usr-local">
<div class="question"><p><b>Q1.4: Why doesn't Fink install into
/usr/local?</b></p></div>
<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> There are several reasons, but the common line is &quot;because
breakage will occur&quot;.</p><p>Reason One: Third-party software. /usr/local is the
well-established place to put software that is not part of the system
shipped by the original vendor. This means that it is a good place to
put stuff. However, it also means that other people will put stuff
there, too. Most install routines will just overwrite what's there -
this also applies to dpkg. One can, of course, choose not to install
third-party software in /usr/local. Unfortunately, most installers
don't tell you beforehand what they will install where.</p><p>Reason Two: /usr/local/bin is in the default PATH. This means that
your shell will find the install programs without additional
measures. But it also means that you do have to take additional
measures if you do not want to use the programs. In extreme cases,
this can also affect the system itself - many parts depend on shell
scripts.</p><p>Reason Three: The compiler tool chain searches /usr/local by
default. The compiler searches /usr/local/include for header files and
the linker searches /usr/local/lib for libraries. Again, this is
sometimes a welcome convenience, but it's very hard to disable should
the need arise. You can easily disable the compiler by putting a
garbage file called <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">stdio.h</tt> into /usr/local/include.</p><p>All that said, it is possible to install Fink into /usr/local. The
installation script will warn you explicitly, but proceed once you
acknowledge that you're doing this at your own risk.</p></div>
</a>
<a name="general.why-sw">
<div class="question"><p><b>Q1.5: Then why did you choose
/sw?</b></p></div>
<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> That choice is quite arbitrary, but is likely to stay for
the forseeable future for practical (upgrade) issues as well as the
fact that it's safe from conflicting with other packaging systems.</p></div>
</a>
<h2><a name="relations">2 Relations with Other Projects</a></h2>


<a name="relations.upstream">
<div class="question"><p><b>Q2.1: Do you contribute your patches
back to the upstream maintainers?</b></p></div>
<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> 
We're trying to.
Sometimes sending patches back is easy and everyone is happy once the
next release of the package is out.
Unfortunately with most packages it's not that easy.
Some common problems:
</p><ul>
<li>The Fink package maintaner is very busy and doesn't have the time
to send the patch and accompanying explanations to the upstream
maintainers.</li>
<li>The upstream maintainers reject the patch. There are lots of valid
reasons for this. Most upstream maintainers have a strong interest in
clean code, clean configure checks, and compatibility with other
platforms.</li>
<li>The upstream maintainers accept the patch, but it takes some weeks
or months until they release a new version of their package.</li>
<li>The package has been abhandoned by the original authors and there
will be no new releases into which the patch could be merged.</li>
</ul></div>
</a>
<a name="relations.debian">
<div class="question"><p><b>Q2.2: What is your relation with the
Debian project? Are you porting Debian Linux to Mac OS X?</b></p></div>
<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> 
There is no formal relation between Fink and
<a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a>.
Fink is <b>not</b> a port of the Debian GNU/Linux distribution.
We have ported Debian's package management tools (dpkg, dselect,
apt-get) though, and use these tools and the .deb binary package
format.
The actual packages are tailor-made for Mac OS X / Darwin and don't
use the Debian source package format.
</p></div>
</a>
<a name="relations.apple">
<div class="question"><p><b>Q2.3: What is your relation with
Apple?</b></p></div>
<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> 
<a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> is aware of Fink and
has given us some support as part of their Open Source relations
efforts.
In the summer and fall of 2001, they provided us with pre-release seeds of
new Mac OS X 
versions in the hope that Fink packages can be adapted in time for the
release.
Quote:
<b>&quot;Hopefully it underscores the commitment that many suspect we're
not willing to provide.  We'll get better at the open source game over
time.&quot;</b>
Thanks Apple!
</p></div>
</a>
<a name="relations.openosx">
<div class="question"><p><b>Q2.4: What is your relation with
OpenOSX.com?</b></p></div>
<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> 
They used Fink to build the first release of their GIMP CD and refuse
to acknowledge that properly.
Read the <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/pr/openosx.php">public
statement</a> for details.
</p></div>
</a>
<a name="relations.forked">
<div class="question"><p><b>Q2.5: What is your relation with macosx.forked.net?</b></p></div>
<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> 
That site redistributes some Fink packages as Installer.app packages,
unchanged but with their own boilerplate that doesn't mention Fink.
Read the <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/pr/forked.php">public
statement</a> for details.
</p></div>
</a>
<a name="relations.darwinports">
<div class="question"><p><b>Q2.6: What is your relation with Darwinports?</b></p></div>
<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> 
			Darwinports and fink are complementary projects. There is some
			overlap between the two projects, and several people contribute to
			both the Fink and Opendarwin projects. For example, Benjamin Reed
			is doing the KDE packages for both. Darwinports/Opendarwin makes
			use of patches from fink, and we have discussed collaboration
			on a new depenency engine.
		</p><p>
			Opendarwin started from scratch to try a different approach to a
			packaging system. Read the statement on <a href="http://www.opendarwin.org/projects/darwinports/en/faq.php">Opendarwin.org</a>

<h2><a name="usage-fink">3 Installing, Using and Maintaining Fink</a></h2>


<a name="usage-fink.what-packages">
<div class="question"><p><b>Q3.1: How can I find out what packages
Fink supports?</b></p></div>
<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> 
Since Fink 0.2.3, there is the <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">list</tt> command.
It produces a list of all packages known to your Fink installation.
Example:
</p><pre>fink list</pre><p>
If you're using the binary distribution, <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">dselect</tt> gives
you a nice browsable listing of available packages.
Note that you must run it as root if you want to select and install
packages from within dselect.
</p><p>
There's also the <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/pdb/">package
database</a> at the website.
</p></div>
</a>
<a name="usage-fink.proxy">
<div class="question"><p><b>Q3.2: I'm behind a firewall. How do I
configure Fink to use an HTTP proxy?</b></p></div>
<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> The <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink</tt> command supports explicit proxy settings that
are passed on to <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">wget</tt>/<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">curl</tt>.
If you were not asked for proxies on first time installation, you can
run <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink configure</tt> to set it up.
You can also run that command at any time to reconfigure the
<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink</tt> command.
If you followed the instructions in the installation guide, and use
<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/sw/bin/init.csh</tt> (or <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/sw/bin/init.sh</tt>),
then <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">apt-get</tt> and <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">dselect</tt> also will use these
proxy settings.  Make sure that you put the protocol in front of the proxy, e.g.</p><pre>ftp://proxy.yoursite.somewhere</pre><p>If you are still having problems, go into System Preferences, select the Network pane, select the Proxies tab, and make sure that the box labled &quot;Use Passive FTP Mode (PASV)&quot; is checked.</p></div>
</a>
<a name="usage-fink.firewalled-cvs">
<div class="question"><p><b>Q3.3: How do I update available packages from CVS when I am behind a firewall?</b></p></div>
<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> The package <b>cvs-proxy</b> can tunnel through HTTP proxies.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>First download the <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/fink/dists/10.2/unstable/main/finkinfo/devel/">cvs-proxy</a> files (an .info file and a .patch file) and place them into your local tree (i.e. /sw/fink/dists/local/main/finkinfo/).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install the <b>cvs-proxy</b> package with the command:</p>
<p>
<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink install <b>cvs-proxy</b>
</tt>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Packages are then updated with the commands:</p>
<p>
<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink selfupdate-cvs</tt>
</p>
<p>
<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink update-all</tt>
</p>
</li>
</ul><p>If fink is not configured to use your proxy, change the settings using:</p><p>
<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink configure</tt>.</p></div>
</a>
<a name="usage-fink.moving">
<div class="question"><p><b>Q3.4: Can I move Fink to another
location after installation?</b></p></div>
<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> 
No.
Well, of course you can move the files using mv or the Finder, but 99%
of the programs will stop working when you do.
That's because basically all Unix software depends on hardcoded paths
to find data files, libraries and other stuff.
</p></div>
</a>
<a name="usage-fink.moving-symlink">
<div class="question"><p><b>Q3.5: If I move Fink after
installation and provide a symlink from the old location, will it
work?</b></p></div>
<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> 
Maybe.
The general expectation is that it should work, but there may be
hidden traps somewhere.
</p></div>
</a>
<a name="usage-fink.removing">
<div class="question"><p><b>Q3.6: How can I remove all
of Fink?</b></p></div>
<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> 
Almost all files installed by Fink are in /sw (or wherever you chose
to install it).  Thus in order to get rid of Fink, enter this command:
</p><pre>sudo rm -rf /sw</pre><p>
The only exception to this rule is XFree86. If you also need to remove
XFree86, additionally enter this:
</p><pre>sudo rm -rf /usr/X11R6 /etc/X11 /Applications/XDarwin.app</pre><p>
You also will want to remove the &quot;source /sw/bin/init.csh&quot; line you
added to your .cshrc file. To do this, type &quot;pico ~/.cshrc&quot;. Navigate to
the &quot;source /sw/bin/init.csh&quot; line and type control-K to remove it. Then
type control-O, return, control-X to exit.
</p></div>
</a>
<a name="usage-fink.kde">
<div class="question"><p><b>Q3.7: What is the status of KDE in Fink?</b></p></div>
<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> 
It works, but there's still plenty to do.
</p><p>
KDE is perfectly usable, but there are parts that still need porting
or tweaking.  There is a group working on finishing and maintaining the
port; for a report on the current status, see their <a href="http://www.opendarwin.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/~checkout~/proj/KDE-Darwin/README.Darwin?rev=HEAD">README file.</a>
</p></div>
</a>
<a name="usage-fink.bindist">
<div class="question"><p><b>Q3.8: The package database at the
website lists package xxx, but apt-get and dselect know nothing about
it. Who's lying?</b></p></div>
<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> 
Both are correct.
The <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/pdb/">package database</a>
knows about every package, including those that are still in the
unstable section.
The <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">dselect</tt> and <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">apt-get</tt> tools on the other
hand only know about the packages available as precompiled binary
packages.
Many packages are not available in precompiled form through these
tools for a variety of reasons.
A package must be in the &quot;stable&quot; section of the latest point release
to be considered, and it must pass additional checks for policy
compliance as well as licensing and patent restrictions.
</p><p>
If you want to install a package that is not available via
<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">dselect</tt> / <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">apt-get</tt>, you have to compile it
from source using <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink install <b>packagename</b>
</tt>.
Make sure you have the Developer Tools installed before you try this.
(If there is no installer for the Developer Tools in your
<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/Applications</tt> folder, you can get them from the <a href="http://connect.apple.com/">Apple Developer Connection</a> after
free registration.)

unstable that I want to install, but the fink command just says 'no
package found'. How can I install it?</b></p></div>
<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> 
First make sure you understand what 'unstable' means.
Packages in there usually have not been tested at all, many have
problems or just won't compile.
That is why Fink doesn't search the unstable tree by default.
</p><p>
If you only want one or two specific packages, it is safer to copy
those .info files (and their associated .patch files, if there are
any) from <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/sw/fink/dists/unstable/main/finkinfo</tt>
to <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/sw/fink/dists/local/main/finkinfo</tt>.
If you want Fink to use all of unstable, edit
<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/sw/etc/fink.conf</tt>, add
<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">unstable/main</tt> and <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">unstable/crypto</tt> 
to the beginning of the <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">Trees:</tt>

<div class="question"><p><b>Q3.10: I'm tired of typing my password into sudo again

<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> If you're not paranoid, you can configure sudo to not ask you for a
password. To do this, edit <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/etc/sudoers</tt> as root
and add a line like this:</p><pre>username  ALL = NOPASSWD: ALL</pre><p>Replace <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">username</tt> with your actual username, of course. This

wrong?</b></p></div>
<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> init.csh is not supposed to be run like normal commands. It
sets environment variables like PATH and MANPATH in your shell. To
have a lasting effect on the shell, it must be processed with the
<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">source</tt> command, like this:</p><pre>source /sw/bin/init.csh</pre><p>The same goes for Bourne-type shells and init.sh.</p></div>

<div class="question"><p><b>Q3.12: Help! I used the

more!</b></p></div>
<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> 
You probably pointed apt at a Debian mirror, which of course doesn't
have the Fink files.
You can fix this manually or through dselect.
To fix it manually, edit the file
<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/sw/etc/apt/sources.list</tt> in a text editor as root.
Remove lines that mention debian.org and replace them with these:
</p><pre>
deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download release main crypto
deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download current main crypto</pre><p>
(Or if you live in Europe, you can use <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">eu.dl.sourceforge.net</tt>
instead of <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">us.dl.sourceforge.net</tt>)
</p><p>
To fix it through dselect, run &quot;[A]ccess&quot; again, choose the &quot;apt&quot;
method and enter the following info:
</p><p>
URL: http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download -
Distribution: release -
Components: main crypto
</p><p>
Then, say you want to add another source and repeat the process with
&quot;current&quot; instead of &quot;release&quot;.
</p><p>
A fixed version of the apt package (which provides the configuration
script as a plug-in for dselect) is making it's way through CVS now.

<a name="usage-fink.selfupdate-tar-fails">
<div class="question"><p><b>Q3.13: Why doesn't 'fink selfupdate'

<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> When using fink selfupdate to update from 0.3.2 (not 0.3.2a), selfupdate may
freeze during the &quot;untar&quot; phase. This will result in fink hanging after the output:</p><pre>I will now download the package descriptions for Fink 0.3.2 and

It may be that the package maintainer has already fixed this, and you will

other directories for the same version of the source that fink wants

old versions of their packages.  If the official site doesn't have it, then
try a web search--sometimes there are unofficial sites that have the

which is where Fink stores sourcefiles from packages that have been 
released in binary form.  If all of the above fail, then you might consider posting on the

you. </p><p>Once you locate the proper source tarball, download it manually, and then move the file into your fink source location (i.e. for a default fink install, &quot;<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">sudo mv <b>package-source.tar.gz</b> /sw/src/</tt>&quot;.  Then use '<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink install <b>packagename</b>

<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> 
(This assumes you are using <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">tcsh</tt>).

This happens when you install the Perl libwww library on an HFS+

overwrites the existing <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">head</tt> command because the file

<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> XFree86, unfortunately, really needs to be installed in /usr/X11R6.  Because of this the fink <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">xfree86-base</tt> and <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">xfree86-rootless</tt> packages install there, too.  However, since fink won't remove any files that aren't in its database, it won't automatically replace a non-fink installation of XFree86.</p><p>
<b>Here's how to proceed:</b>
</p><p>1. Uninstall <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">xaw3d</tt> and <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">xaw3d-shlibs</tt> if you installed them with fink, and their version is 1.5-4 or earlier, because they also install in /usr/X11R6 (this is no longer the case for 1.5-5 and later versions).</p><p>2. Remove <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">system-xfree86</tt>.  If you don't have any packages that depend on X11, this is straightforward.

<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">sudo dpkg --remove --force-depends system-xfree86</tt>
</p><p>to remove it, leaving everything in place.  If you don't have <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">system-xfree86</tt> installed then proceed to step 3.</p><p>3. Manually remove all of XFree86.  This can be done with</p><p>
<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">sudo rm -rf /Applications/XDarwin.app /usr/X11R6 /etc/X11</tt>

<a name="usage-general.passwd">
<div class="question"><p><b>Q6.3: There are suddenly a number of 
strange users on my system, with names like &quot;mysql&quot;, &quot;pgsql&quot;, and &quot;games&quot;.  
Where did they come from?</b></p></div>
<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> 
You have used Fink to install a package which is dependent on another package,
passwd.  passwd installs a number of extra users on your system for security 
reasons -- on Unix systems, files and processes belong to &quot;owners&quot;, which 
allows
system administrators to fine-tune the permissions and security of the system. 
 Programs such as Apache and MySQL need an &quot;owner&quot;, and it is insecure to 
assign these daemons to root (imagine what would happen if Apache were to be 
compromised and suddenly had write permission to all files on the system).  
Thus, the passwd package takes the work out of setting up these extra users 
for Fink packages that require this.</p><p>It can be alarming to suddenly discover a number of unexpected users in your
 &quot;System Preferences: Users&quot; pane, but suppress the urge to delete them:
</p><ul>
<li>First of all, you have obviously chosen to install a package which requires
 their use, so deleting the user doesn't make much sense, does it?</li>
<li>There are in fact a number of extra users already installed on Mac OS X 
that you may not have known about:  www, daemon, nobody, are just a few of 
them.
The presence of these extra users is a standard Unix convention for running 
certain services; the passwd package simply adds a couple of extra that Apple 
did not provide.  You can see these Apple-installed users in NetInfo 
Manager.app, or by running
<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">niutil -list . /users</tt>
</li>
<li>If you do decide to delete these users, be very careful of how you go about
 it.  Using the &quot;System Preferences: Users&quot; pane will assign all of their files
 to a random administrator account, and there have been reports of havoc played
 with the administrator account's permissions.  This is a bug with System 
Preferences, and has been submitted to Apple.  A safer way to remove these 
users from your system is to do so from within NetInfo Manager.app or use the 
command line tool <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">niutil</tt> in Terminal.  Read the man page
 for <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">niutil</tt> for more information about NetInfo.</li>
</ul><p>Fink <b>does</b> request permission to install these additional users on 
your system during the installation of the passwd package, so this should not 
have come as a surprise.

<a name="usage-general.compile-myself">
<div class="question"><p><b>Q6.4: How do I compile something
myself using fink-installed software?</b></p></div>
<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> When compiling something yourself outside of fink, the compiler and
linker need to be told where to find the fink-installed libraries and
headers. For a package that uses standard configure/make process, you
need to set the CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, and LDFLAGS environment
variables:
</p><pre>
setenv CFLAGS -I/sw/include
setenv LDFLAGS -L/sw/lib
setenv CXXFLAGS $CFLAGS
setenv CPPFLAGS $CXXFLAGS
</pre><p>
It is often easiest just to add these to your .tcshrc or .cshrc so they
are set automatically.
If a package does not use these variables, you may need to add the
&quot;-I/sw/include&quot; (for headers) and &quot;-L/sw/lib&quot; (for libraries) to the
compile lines yourself. Some packages may use similar non-standard
variables such as EXTRA_CFLAGS or --with-qt-dir= configure options.
&quot;./configure --help&quot; will usually give you a list of the extra configure
options.
</p><p>In addition, you may need to install the development headers (e.g. <b>foo-1.0-1-dev</b> for the library packages that you are using, if they aren't already installed.</p></div>

<a name="usage-general.libpng-versions">
<div class="question"><p><b>Q6.5: When I try to run an application, I get messages about incompatible versions of libpng.  What does this mean?</b></p></div>
<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> This is relevant to you if you see messages such as:</p><pre>libpng warning: Application was compiled with png.h from libpng-1.2.5
libpng warning: Application  is running with png.c from libpng-1.0.12
libpng error: Incompatible libpng version in application and library</pre><p>when running certain X applications.  The problem is only known to affect packages in the unstable tree, and is due to an incompatiblity between libpng and libpng3.  Most of the offending packages have been tracked down and updated to solve this problem. If you currently have the unstable tree enabled in your  <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink.conf</tt>, then run &quot;<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink selfupdate-cvs</tt>&quot; to update your package descriptions, and then you can update your package and its dependencies as usual with &quot;<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink update <b>packagename</b>
</tt>&quot; or &quot;<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">fink update-all</tt>&quot;.  If you are just using particular packages in unstable, then you may also need to update some of the packages noted in the Depends: and BuildDepends: fields of its .info file, because they may depend on libpng.</p><p>If you do the update and things still don't work, then you may have encountered a package that hasn't been modified yet.

<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> Apple X11 doesn't keep track of the fink environment settings, which means that the Applications menu doesn't have the PATH set correctly to find your fink apps.  The solution is to preface the name of a fink-installed application with</p><pre>source /sw/bin/init.sh ; </pre><p>For example, if you want to run a fink-installed GIMP, then put</p><pre>source /sw/bin/init.sh ; gimp</pre><p>in the Command field of your GIMP entry.</p></div>

<a name="usage-packages.xmms-quiet">
<div class="question"><p><b>Q7.2: I get no sound from
XMMS</b></p></div>
<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> 
Make sure you have the &quot;eSound Output Plugin&quot; selected in the XMMS
preferences.
For some strange reason, it selects the disk writer plugin as the
default.
</p><p>
If you still get no sound output or XMMS complains that it can't find
your sound card try this:
</p><ul>
<li>Make sure you haven't muted sound output in Mac OS X.</li>
<li>Run <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">esdcat /usr/libexec/config.guess</tt> (or any other
file of a decent size).
If you hear a short noise, esound works and XMMS should work too if
it's configured correctly.
If you don't hear anything, esd isn't working for some reason.
You can try to start it up manually with <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">esd &amp;</tt> and watch
the messages.
</li>
<li>
If it still doesn't work, check the permissions on
<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/tmp/.esd</tt> and <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/tmp/.esd/socket</tt>.
Those should have your normal user account as the owner.
If they aren't owned by you, kill esd if it's running, remove the
directory as root (<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">sudo rm -rf /tmp/.esd</tt>), then start esd
again (as a normal user, not as root).
</li>
</ul><p>
Note that esd is designed to be run by a normal user, not by root.
It usually communicates via the file system socket
<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">/tmp/.esd/socket</tt>.
You only need the <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">-tcp</tt> and <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">-port</tt> switches if
you want to run esd clients on another machine over the network.
</p><p>
There have also been reports of XMMS crashing or freezing on 10.1.
We don't have an analysis or a fix yet.

OS X 10.1 and now XFree86 always quits immediately. In the messages it
says &quot;assert failed on line 454 of darwinKeyboard.c!&quot;. What's
wrong?</b></p></div>
<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> 
This is a known problem on 10.1.
You must use the &quot;Load from file&quot; keymapping option since the default
option (loading it from the kernel) doesn't work anymore.
The setting is in the XDarwin Preferences dialog.
Be sure that a file is selected (e.g. USA.keymapping) - simply
activating the check box may not be sufficient with some versions.
If you can't get to the Preferences dialog because you disabled all
splash screens, you can delete
<tt style="white-space: nowrap;">~/Library/Preferences/org.xfree86.XDarwin.plist</tt> to get it
back, then start XDarwin and go to the Preferences dialog while the
splash screen is displayed.
Alternatively, you can edit that file manually in a text editor to
enable the keymapping option (the UseKeymappingFile and KeymappingFile
bits).
</p><p>
As a last resort, you can run <tt style="white-space: nowrap;">startx -- -quartz -keymap
USA.keymapping</tt> from Terminal.app.
If this still doesn't work, you have another problem in addition to
the keymapping problem that prevents XDarwin from starting.
You'll get a bunch of diagnostic messages in Terminal.app to help you
sort this out.

<div class="answer"><p><b>A:</b> 
  First of all, if you previously had the &quot;threaded&quot; versions of Fink's XFree86 packages installed, you may need to rebuild the application that is crashing.  Some programs check for the availability of threading at build time, and then from then on believe that threading is available to them.
 </p><p>
  Secondly, you may have just hit an Apple X11 bug.  As of the time of this writing, a number of bugs are known by the Apple team and are being worked on.
