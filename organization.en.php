<h1>Organization of Fink</h1>

<p>The Fink project works through volunteers, and a fairly loose 
organizational structure.  At present, the Fink Core Team and the
Fink Translators are the most highly organized groups within the
Fink project.</p>

<a name="core"><h2>The Fink Core Team</h2></a>

<p>The Fink Core Team is responsible for several aspects of central
management of the Fink project.  Team members work on the fink program 
itself and
coordinate contributions of others to that program; they serve as
Maintainers for all of the "essential" packages in the Fink collection,
and ensure that bootstrapping with these essential packages works;
they manage releases of the fink program and related programs;
they manage creation and release of major fink distributions,
including the source and binary distributions.  They also help to
coordinate the other groups of volunteers who work on the Fink
project. 
</p>

<p>The current Fink Core members are Augusto Devegili, Alexander Hansen, Max
Horn, Daniel Macks, David R. Morrison, Benjamin Reed and Dave Vasilevsky.  They
can be reached at &lt;fink-core@lists.sourceforge.net&gt;.

<p>Description coming soon...</p>
