<h1>Organization of Fink</h1>

<p>The Fink project works through volunteers, and a fairly loose 
organizational structure.  At present, the Fink Core Team and the
Fink Translators are the most highly organized groups within the
Fink project.</p>

<a name="core"><h2>The Fink Core Team</h2></a>

<p>The Fink Core Team is responsible for several aspects of central
management of the fink project.  They work on the fink program and
coordinate contributions of others to that program; they serve as
Maintainers for all of the "essential" packages in the Fink collection,
and ensure that bootstrapping with these essential packages works;
they manage releases of the fink program and related programs;
they managre creation and release of major fink distributions,
including the source and binary distribution.  They also help to
coordinate the other groups of volunteers which work on the Fink
project. 
</p>

<p>The current fink core members are Max Horn, Daniel Macks, Dave
Morrison, Peter O'Gorman, and Ben Reed.  They can be reached at
&lt;fink-core@lists.sourceforge.net&gt;.

<h2>The Fink Translators</h2>

<p>Description coming soon...</p>
