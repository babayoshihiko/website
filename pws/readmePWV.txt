  http://phpwebstats.sourceforge.net

------------------
 Introduction
------------------
This is the phpWebStats package, which should do basic web traffic
logging and analysis for your site. It's written in PHP and SQL, so all
you need to use it is hosting with PHP and MySQL (at this time the only
SQL database supported by me).
