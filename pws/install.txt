 Installation
----------------
The installation and usage of this package is pretty simple. These are the 
presumptions:

   1) You have access to hosting (free or commercial), supporting PHP and MySQL
   2) You  have these information about the database: database name, hostname,
      username and password 

It's not important if the database used for phpWebStats is separated from other
databases. In fact you can use the same database as long as no table name
collision occures. The table names for phpWebStats use "pws_" prefix (pws_arch,
pws_browser, pws_country, pws_lang, pws_os and pws_stats) so the collision is
improbable.

If you don't have the information about the database presented above, contact
the administrator or create the database yourself (if you have the necessary
privileges).

---------------------------------------
 A) Installation of the database part
---------------------------------------
The database installation consists of two steps - creation of structure (i.e.
tables) and import of data (signatures, etc.). These steps are done running
two SQL scripts, namely structure.sql and import.sql, located in the database/
directory. All you have to do is run these scripts from command-line

  # mysql -u username -p database_name < structure.sql
  # mysql -u username -p database_name < import.sql

or run them using phpMyAdmin or any other tool. Now installation of the database
part is finished.

(Partial czech translation of database items - country names only - is
available. If you want to use this translation, use importcz.sql file in the
previous step, not import.sql.)  

---------------------------------
 B) Installation of the sources 
---------------------------------
There are three main source files in source/ directory

  1) stats.php - used for detecting and logging the information into the
     database 
  2) analyze.php - used for analysis of the data (retrieving the data from the 
     database)
  3) bro.php - database abstraction library, used by both php files presented
     above
     
Copy these files into your include directory, and use them as all other php 
"libraries." There's another one file "check.php" I'm using to set/check the 
visitor ID. It does the following:

(1) It checks if the visitor id is stored in the session.
(2) If it isn't in a session, then it it means it's the first page in this
    session. Next it checks if there's a cookie "visitor id" (if the client
    has been on this page before).
(3) If it isn't in a Cookie, then it means the client is a new one, so a new
    visitor ID is created using md5(). This new ID is then stored in a session
    and sent to the client as a cookie.
(4) If it's in a Cookie, then the client is returning to our page, so we'll use
    this old ID.

Well, it's not perfect. The client can deny our cookie, there can be more client
using one computer, etc.

 C) Setting database information
-------------------------------------
The last step you have to do is to open the bro.php file, and set actual 
database information at the top of the file.
