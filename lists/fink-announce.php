<h1>fink-announce Mailing List</h1>

<p>
The fink-announce list is a low traffic list where release
announcements are posted, usually some minutes after the release
happened.
If you want to be the first to hear about new releases, subscribe to
this list.
</p>
<p>
The list is moderated to make sure that only release announcements are
posted.
If you have other announcements to make, post them to
<a href="fink-users.php">fink-users</a> instead.
