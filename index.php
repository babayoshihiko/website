<p>
The Fink project wants to bring the full world of Unix
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source</a> software to
<a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/">Darwin</a> and
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a>.
We modify Unix software so that it compiles and runs on Mac OS X
("port" it) and make it available for download as a coherent
distribution.
Fink uses <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> tools like dpkg
and apt-get to provide powerful binary package management.
You can choose whether you want to download precompiled binary
packages or build everything from source.
