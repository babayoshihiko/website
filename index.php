<p>
The Fink project wants to bring the full world of Unix
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source</a> software to
<a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/">Darwin</a> and
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a>.
We modify Unix software so that it compiles and runs on Mac OS X
("port" it) and make it available for download as a coherent
distribution.
Fink uses <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> tools like dpkg
and apt-get to provide powerful binary package management.
You can choose whether you want to download precompiled binary
packages or build everything from source.

<p>2002-01-08:
Due to a faulty script, the whole fink website, including our
binary distro, has been wiped! This means you can't use the binary
distro right now. I am working as quick as I can on uploading
the new Fink 0.3.2 binary distro. In addition, the package database
is not working for now. Please bear with us.

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>
Fink 0.3.2a was released on 16 January 2002.
The source release and the binary installer are available now, the
other binary packages are still being built.
