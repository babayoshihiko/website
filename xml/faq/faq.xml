<p>This is the list of frequently asked questions about Fink. Like
in most FAQs, some questions are taken from real life and some are
made up. It's really more like a documentation written in an ad-hoc,
question and answer style.</p>
<p>The FAQ consists of several pages, one for each section. All
questions are listed and linked in the table of contents below.</p>

<title>General Questions</title>
<shorttitle>General</shorttitle>
<faqentry name="what" >
<question>
<p>What is Fink?</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>
Fink wants to bring more Unix software to Mac OS X, which results in
two main goals:
</p>
<p>
Goal number one is porting software to Mac OS X.
That means we take commodity Open Source Unix software and fix
whatever is necessary so that it will compile and run on Mac OS X.
Sometimes that's easy, but it can also be very hard or even impossible
for some packages.
We're trying to provide tools and documentation to make this easier.
</p>
<p>
Goal number two is making the results available to casual users.
For this, we build a distribution using package management tools
ported over from Linux, namely <code>dpkg</code> and
<code>apt-get</code>, written by and for the <link url="http://www.debian.org/" >Debian GNU/Linux</link> project.
The binary distribution uses the <code>.deb</code> package format.
For building packages from source, we have our own tool, named
<code>fink</code>, which creates those <code>.deb</code> package
files.

<faqentry name="naming" >
<question>
<p>What does the name Fink stand for?</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>Nothing, it's just a name. It's not even an acronym.</p>
<p>Well, actually Fink is the German name for Finch, a kind of
bird. I was looking for a name for the project, and the name of the
OS, Darwin, led me to think about Charles Darwin, the Galapagos
Islands and evolution. I remembered a piece about the so-called Darwin
Finches and their beaks from school, and well, that's it...</p>

<faqentry name="bsd-ports" >
<question>
<p>How is Fink different
from the BSD port mechanism (this includes OpenPackages and
GNU-Darwin)?</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>Some main advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
It's written in Perl, not make/shell.
Thus it doesn't rely on special features only found in BSD make.
There is no need to flag packages that need GNU make to build.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
dpkg provides sophisticated management for binary packages - smooth
updating, special handling for configuration files, virtual packages
and other advanced dependencies.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fink doesn't install into /usr/local unless explicitly requested and
doesn't require fiddling with /usr/bin/make or other system-provided
commands.
That makes it safer to use and reduces interference with Mac OS X and
third-party packages to a minimum.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</answer>
</faqentry>
<faqentry name="usr-local" >
<question>
<p>Why doesn't Fink install into
/usr/local?</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>There are several reasons, but the common line is &quot;because
breakage will occur&quot;.</p>
<p>Reason One: Third-party software. /usr/local is the
well-established place to put software that is not part of the system
shipped by the original vendor. This means that it is a good place to
put stuff. However, it also means that other people will put stuff
there, too. Most install routines will just overwrite what's there -
this also applies to dpkg. One can, of course, choose not to install
third-party software in /usr/local. Unfortunately, most installers
don't tell you beforehand what they will install where.</p>
<p>Reason Two: /usr/local/bin is in the default PATH. This means that
your shell will find the install programs without additional
measures. But it also means that you do have to take additional
measures if you do not want to use the programs. In extreme cases,
this can also affect the system itself - many parts depend on shell
scripts.</p>
<p>Reason Three: The compiler tool chain searches /usr/local by
default. The compiler searches /usr/local/include for header files and
the linker searches /usr/local/lib for libraries. Again, this is
sometimes a welcome convenience, but it's very hard to disable should
the need arise. You can easily disable the compiler by putting a
garbage file called <code>stdio.h</code> into /usr/local/include.</p>
<p>All that said, it is possible to install Fink into /usr/local. The
installation script will warn you explicitly, but proceed once you
acknowledge that you're doing this at your own risk.</p>
</answer>
</faqentry>
<faqentry name="why-sw" >
<question>
<p>Then why did you choose
/sw?</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>That choice is quite arbitrary, but is likely to stay for
the forseeable future for practical (upgrade) issues as well as the
fact that it's safe from conflicting with other packaging systems.</p>

<faqentry name="upstream" >
<question>
<p>Do you contribute your patches
back to the upstream maintainers?</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>
We're trying to.
Sometimes sending patches back is easy and everyone is happy once the
next release of the package is out.
Unfortunately with most packages it's not that easy.
Some common problems:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The Fink package maintaner is very busy and doesn't have the time
to send the patch and accompanying explanations to the upstream
maintainers.</li>
<li>The upstream maintainers reject the patch. There are lots of valid
reasons for this. Most upstream maintainers have a strong interest in
clean code, clean configure checks, and compatibility with other
platforms.</li>
<li>The upstream maintainers accept the patch, but it takes some weeks
or months until they release a new version of their package.</li>
<li>The package has been abhandoned by the original authors and there
will be no new releases into which the patch could be merged.</li>
</ul>

<faqentry name="debian" >
<question>
<p>What is your relation with the
Debian project? Are you porting Debian Linux to Mac OS X?</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>
There is no formal relation between Fink and
<link url="http://www.debian.org" >Debian</link>.
Fink is <em>not</em> a port of the Debian GNU/Linux distribution.
We have ported Debian's package management tools (dpkg, dselect,
apt-get) though, and use these tools and the .deb binary package
format.
The actual packages are tailor-made for Mac OS X / Darwin and don't
use the Debian source package format.

<faqentry name="apple" >
<question>
<p>What is your relation with
Apple?</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>
<link url="http://www.apple.com/" >Apple</link> is aware of Fink and
has given us some support as part of their Open Source relations
efforts.
In the summer and fall of 2001, they provided us with pre-release seeds of
new Mac OS X 
versions in the hope that Fink packages can be adapted in time for the
release.
Quote:
<em>&quot;Hopefully it underscores the commitment that many suspect we're
not willing to provide.  We'll get better at the open source game over
time.&quot;</em>

<faqentry name="what-packages" >
<question>
<p>How can I find out what packages
Fink supports?</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>
Since Fink 0.2.3, there is the <code>list</code> command.
It produces a list of all packages known to your Fink installation.
Example:
</p>
<codeblock>fink list</codeblock>
<p>
If you're using the binary distribution, <code>dselect</code> gives
you a nice browsable listing of available packages.
Note that you must run it as root if you want to select and install
packages from within dselect.
</p>
<p>
There's also the <link url="http://fink.sourceforge.net/pdb/" >package
database</link> at the website.

</faqentry>
<faqentry name="proxy" >
<question>
<p>I'm behind a firewall. How do I
configure Fink to use an HTTP proxy?</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>
The <code>fink</code> command supports explicit proxy settings that
are passed on to <code>wget</code> resp. <code>curl</code>.
If you were not asked for proxies on first time installation, you can
run <code>fink configure</code> to set it up.
You can also run that command at any time to reconfigure the
<code>fink</code> command.
If you followed the instructions in the installation guide, and use
<filename>/sw/bin/init.csh</filename> (or <filename>/sw/bin/init.sh</filename>),
then <code>apt-get</code> and <code>dselect</code> also will use these
proxy settings.
</p>
</answer>
</faqentry>
<faqentry name="firewalled-cvs" >
<question>
<p>How do I update available packages from CVS when I am behind a firewall?</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>The package <em>cvs-proxy</em> can tunnel through HTTP proxies.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First download the <link url="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/fink/dists/10.2/unstable/main/finkinfo/devel/" >cvs-proxy</link> files (an .info file and a .patch file) and place them into your local tree (i.e. /sw/fink/dists/local/main/finkinfo/).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install the <em>cvs-proxy</em> package with the command:</p>
<p>
<code>fink install <em>cvs-proxy</em>
</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Packages are then updated with the commands:</p>
<p>
<code>fink selfupdate-cvs</code>
</p>
<p>
<code>fink update-all</code>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If fink is not configured to use your proxy, change the settings using:</p>
<p>
<code>fink configure</code>.</p>

<faqentry name="moving" >
<question>
<p>Can I move Fink to another
location after installation?</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>
No.
Well, of course you can move the files using mv or the Finder, but 99%
of the programs will stop working when you do.
That's because basically all Unix software depends on hardcoded paths
to find data files, libraries and other stuff.

</answer>
</faqentry>
<faqentry name="moving-symlink" >
<question>
<p>If I move Fink after
installation and provide a symlink from the old location, will it
work?</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>
Maybe.
The general expectation is that it should work, but there may be
hidden traps somewhere.
</p>
</answer>
</faqentry>
<faqentry name="removing" >
<question>
<p>How can I remove all
of Fink?</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>
Almost all files installed by Fink are in /sw (or wherever you chose
to install it).  Thus in order to get rid of Fink, enter this command:
</p>
<codeblock>sudo rm -rf /sw</codeblock>
<p>
The only exception to this rule is XFree86. If you also need to remove
XFree86, additionally enter this:
</p>
<codeblock>sudo rm -rf /usr/X11R6 /etc/X11 /Applications/XDarwin.app</codeblock>
<p>
You also will want to remove the &quot;source /sw/bin/init.csh&quot; line you
added to your .cshrc file. To do this, type &quot;pico ~/.cshrc&quot;. Navigate to
the &quot;source /sw/bin/init.csh&quot; line and type control-K to remove it. Then
type control-O, return, control-X to exit.

<faqentry name="kde" >
<question>
<p>What is the status of KDE in Fink?</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>
It works, but there's still plenty to do.
</p>
<p>
KDE is perfectly usable, but there are parts that still need porting
or tweaking.  There is a group working on finishing and maintaining the
port; for a report on the current status, see their <link url="http://www.opendarwin.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/~checkout~/proj/KDE-Darwin/README.Darwin?rev=HEAD" >README file.</link>
</p>
</answer>
</faqentry>
<faqentry name="bindist" >
<question>
<p>The package database at the
website lists package xxx, but apt-get and dselect know nothing about
it. Who's lying?</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>
Both are correct.
The <link url="http://fink.sourceforge.net/pdb/" >package database</link>
knows about every package, including those that are still in the
unstable section.
The <code>dselect</code> and <code>apt-get</code> tools on the other
hand only know about the packages available as precompiled binary
packages.
Many packages are not available in precompiled form through these
tools for a variety of reasons.
A package must be in the &quot;stable&quot; section of the latest point release
to be considered, and it must pass additional checks for policy
compliance as well as licensing and patent restrictions.
</p>
<p>
If you want to install a package that is not available via
<code>dselect</code> / <code>apt-get</code>, you have to compile it
from source using <code>fink install <em>packagename</em>
</code>.
Make sure you have the Developer Tools installed before you try this.
(If there is no installer for the Developer Tools in your
<code>/Applications</code> folder, you can get them from the <link url="http://connect.apple.com/" >Apple Developer Connection</link> after
free registration.)
See also the question about unstable below.
</p>
</answer>
</faqentry>
<faqentry name="unstable" >
<question>
<p>There's this package in
unstable that I want to install, but the fink command just says 'no
package found'. How can I install it?</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>
First make sure you understand what 'unstable' means.
Packages in there usually have not been tested at all, many have
problems or just won't compile.
That is why Fink doesn't search the unstable tree by default.
</p>
<p>
If you only want one or two specific packages, it is safer to copy
those .info files (and their associated .patch files, if there are
any) from <filename>/sw/fink/dists/unstable/main/finkinfo</filename>
to <filename>/sw/fink/dists/local/main/finkinfo</filename>.
If you want Fink to use all of unstable, edit
<filename>/sw/etc/fink.conf</filename>, add
<code>unstable/main</code> and <code>unstable/crypto</code> 
to the beginning of the <code>Trees:</code>
line, and then run the command <code>fink index</code>

</faqentry>
<faqentry name="sudo" >
<question>
<p>I'm tired of typing my password into sudo again
and again. Is there a way around this?</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>If you're not paranoid, you can configure sudo to not ask you for a
password. To do this, edit <filename>/etc/sudoers</filename> as root
and add a line like this:</p>
<codeblock>username  ALL = NOPASSWD: ALL</codeblock>
<p>Replace <code>username</code> with your actual username, of course. This
line allows you to run any command via sudo without typing your
password.</p>
</answer>
</faqentry>
<faqentry name="exec-init-csh" >
<question>
<p>When I try to run
init.csh, I get a &quot;Permission denied&quot; error. What am I doing
wrong?</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>init.csh is not supposed to be run like normal commands. It
sets environment variables like PATH and MANPATH in your shell. To
have a lasting effect on the shell, it must be processed with the
<code>source</code> command, like this:</p>
<codeblock>source /sw/bin/init.csh</codeblock>
<p>The same goes for Bourne-type shells and init.sh.</p>
</answer>

<faqentry name="dselect-access" >
<question>
<p>Help! I used the
&quot;[A]ccess&quot; menu entry in dselect and now I can't download packages any
more!</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>
You probably pointed apt at a Debian mirror, which of course doesn't
have the Fink files.
You can fix this manually or through dselect.
To fix it manually, edit the file
<code>/sw/etc/apt/sources.list</code> in a text editor as root.
Remove lines that mention debian.org and replace them with these:
</p>
<codeblock>
deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download release main crypto
deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download current main crypto</codeblock>
<p>
(Or if you live in Europe, you can use <code>eu.dl.sourceforge.net</code>
instead of <code>us.dl.sourceforge.net</code>)
</p>
<p>
To fix it through dselect, run &quot;[A]ccess&quot; again, choose the &quot;apt&quot;
method and enter the following info:
</p>
<p>
URL: http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download -
Distribution: release -
Components: main crypto
</p>
<p>
Then, say you want to add another source and repeat the process with
&quot;current&quot; instead of &quot;release&quot;.
</p>
<p>
A fixed version of the apt package (which provides the configuration
script as a plug-in for dselect) is making it's way through CVS now.

<faqentry name="selfupdate-tar-fails" >
<question>
<p>Why doesn't 'fink selfupdate'
work?</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>When using fink selfupdate to update from 0.3.2 (not 0.3.2a), selfupdate may
freeze during the &quot;untar&quot; phase. This will result in fink hanging after the output:</p>
<codeblock>I will now download the package descriptions for Fink 0.3.2 and
update the core packages. After that, you should update the other
packages using commands like 'fink update-all'.

curl -L -s -S -O http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/fink/packages-0.3.2.tar.gz
tar -xzf -</codeblock>
<p>This is a known bug in 0.3.2 that was fixed in 0.3.2a. If you encounter this 
problem, there are two easy workarounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Downgrade to a previous version of fink, then run</p>
<codeblock>fink selfupdate</codeblock>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manually install the latest version of the package manager. Go to the
    <link url="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/srcdist.php" >source release
    download page</link> and get the latest version, then update like this:</p>
<codeblock>tar -xzf fink--full.tar.gz
cd fink--full/
./inject.pl /sw
cd pkginfo
./inject.pl /sw</codeblock>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Or, if you are happy with modifying a file in the distribution manually, you can
edit line 479 of <filename>/sw/lib/perl5/Fink/SelfUpdate.pm</filename> and change:</p>
<codeblock>$unpack_cmd = &quot;tar -xz${verbosity}f -&quot;;</codeblock>
<p>to</p>
<codeblock>$unpack_cmd = &quot;tar -xz${verbosity}f $pkgtarball&quot;;</codeblock>
<p>It is always a good idea to make a backup of any file before modifying it.</p>

<question>
<p>When I try to run &quot;fink selfupdate&quot; or &quot;fink selfupdate-cvs&quot;, I get the error &quot;<code>Updating using CVS failed. Check the error messages above.</code>&quot;
		</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>If the message is</p>
<codeblock>Can't exec &quot;cvs&quot;: No such file or directory at 
/sw/lib/perl5/Fink/Services.pm line 216, &lt;STDIN> line 3.
### execution of cvs failed, exit code -1</codeblock>
<p>then you need to install the Developer Tools.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, the last line is</p>
<codeblock>### execution of su failed, exit code 1</codeblock>
<p>you'll need to look further back in the output to see the error.  If you see a message that your connection was refused:</p>
<codeblock>
(Logging in to anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net)
CVS password:
cvs [login aborted]: connect to cvs.sourceforge.net:2401 failed:
Connection refused
### execution of su failed, exit code 1
Failed: Logging into the CVS server for anonymous read-only access failed.
		</codeblock>
<p>or a message like the following:</p>
<codeblock>cvs [update aborted]: recv() from server cvs.sourceforge.net: 
Connection reset by peer
### execution of su failed, exit code 1
Failed: Updating using CVS failed. Check the error messages above.</codeblock>
<p>Then it's likely that the cvs servers are overloaded and you have to try the update later.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that you have some bad permissions in your CVS directories , in which case you get &quot;Permission denied&quot; messages:</p>
<codeblock>
cvs update: in directory 10.2/stable/main:
cvs update: cannot open CVS/Entries for reading: No such file or  directory
cvs server: Updating 10.2/stable/main
cvs update: cannot write 10.2/stable/main/.cvsignore: Permission denied
cvs [update aborted]: cannot make directory 10.2/stable/main/finkinfo:  No such file or directory
### execution of su failed, exit code 1
Failed: Updating using CVS failed. Check the error messages above.
</codeblock>
<p>In this case you need to reset your cvs directories. Use the command:</p>
<codeblock> 
sudo find /sw/fink -type d -name 'CVS' -exec rm -rf {} \;
fink selfupdate-cvs
		</codeblock>
<p>If, you don't see either of the above messages, then this almost always means you've modified a file in your /sw/fink/dists tree and now the maintainer has changed it.  Look further back in the selfupdate-cvs output for lines that start with &quot;C&quot;, like so:
</p>
<codeblock>C 10.2/unstable/main/finkinfo/libs/db31-3.1.17-6.info
...
(other info and patch files)
...
### execution of su failed, exit code 1
Failed: Updating using CVS failed. Check the error messages above.</codeblock>
<p>The &quot;C&quot; means CVS had a conflict in trying to update the latest version.</p>
<p>The fix is to delete any files that show up as starting with &quot;C&quot; in the output of selfupdate-cvs, and try again.</p>
<codeblock>sudo rm /sw/fink/10.2/unstable/main/finkinfo/libs/db31-3.1.17-6.info

<question>
<p>I ran the fink-0.4.1 installer and now I can't log in to my machine!</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>This is fixed now, but there was a <link url="http://fink.sourceforge.net/news/index.php" >problem</link> wherein if one used the 0.4.1 installer twice some key system permissions got screwed up.  Fortunately, this problem can be fixed.</p>
<p>Perform the follwing sequence of operations:</p>
<p>1.  Start up in Single-User Mode (press and hold the Command-S key combination during startup until white text appears).</p>
<p>2.  When the command line appears, do the following commands:</p>
<codeblock>
fsck -y
mount -uw
chmod 1775 /
reboot
</codeblock>
<p>3.  Your system should reboot.  Once it does, you should perform &quot;<code>sudo rm -rf /Library/Receipts/Fink 0.4.1 Installer.pkg</code>&quot; to prevent this from happening again.</p>

<faqentry name="not-found" >
<question>
<p>I'm trying to install a package, but fink can't download it.  The download site shows a later version number of the package than what fink has.  What do I do?</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>The package sources get moved around by the upstream sites when new
versions are released.</p>
<p>The first thing you should do is run <code>fink selfupdate-cvs</code>.
It may be that the package maintainer has already fixed this, and you will
get an updated package description with either a more recent version or a
revised download URL.</p>
<p>If this doesn't work, please let the package maintainer (available from &quot;<code>fink describe <em>packagename</em>
</code>&quot;) know that the URL is broken; not all maintainers read the mailing lists all of the time.</p>
<p>To get a usable source, first try hunting around the remote site in
other directories for the same version of the source that fink wants 
(e.g. in an &quot;old&quot;
directory).  Keep in mind, though, that some remote sites like to trash the
old versions of their packages.  If the official site doesn't have it, then
try a web search--sometimes there are unofficial sites that have the 
tarball you want.  Another place to look is <link url="http://us.dl.sf.net/fink/direct_download/source/" >http://us.dl.sf.net/fink/direct_download/source/</link>, 
which is where Fink stores sourcefiles from packages that have been 
released in binary form.  If all of the above fail, then you might consider posting on the

mailing list</link> to ask if anybody has the old source available to give
you. </p>
<p>Once you locate the proper source tarball, download it manually, and then move the file into your fink source location (i.e. for a default fink install, &quot;<code>sudo mv <em>package-source.tar.gz</em> /sw/src/</code>&quot;.  Then use '<code>fink install <em>packagename</em>

<p>If you can't get the source file, then you'll have to wait for the maintainer to deal with the problem.  They may either post a link to the old source, or update the .info and .patch files to use the newer version.

<faqentry name="fink-not-found" >
<question>
<p>I've edited my .cshrc and started a new terminal, but I still get &quot;fink: command not found&quot;.</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>
(This assumes you are using <filename>tcsh</filename>).  When <filename>tcsh</filename> is started, it first reads system-wide scripts, and then those for your user account.  It looks first for <filename>~/.tcshrc</filename>, and if that isn't found, <filename>~/.cshrc</filename>; note that if you have both, only <filename>~/.tcshrc</filename> gets run.</p>
<p>What has probably happened is that some application package (e.g. CodeWarrior) has created a <filename>~/.tcshrc</filename>, and therefore <filename>~/.cshrc</filename> isn't being read.  A good fix is to add the following line to <filename>~/.tcshrc</filename>:</p>

<question>
<p>I want to hide /sw in the Finder to keep users from damaging the fink setup.</p>

<p>You can indeed do this.  If you have the Development Tools installed, then you can run the following command:</p>
<codeblock>sudo /Developer/Tools/SetFile -a V /sw</codeblock>
<p>This makes /sw invisible, just like the standard system folders (/usr, etc.).  If you don't have the Developer Tools, there are various third-party applications that let you manipulate file attributes--you need to set /sw to be invisible.</p>

<question>
<p>I can't install anything, because I get the following error: &quot;install-info: unrecognized option `--infodir=/sw/share/info'&quot;</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>This usually is due to a problem in your PATH.  In a terminal window type:</p>
<codeblock>printenv PATH</codeblock>
<p>If <filename>/sw/sbin</filename> doesn't appear at all, then you need to set your environment up as per the <link url="http://fink.sourceforge.net/doc/users-guide/install.php#setup" >instructions</link> in the Users Guide.  If <filename>/sw/sbin</filename> is there, but there are other directories ahead of it (e.g. <filename>/usr/local/bin</filename>), then you will either want to reorder your PATH so that <filename>/sw/sbin</filename> is near the beginning, or if you really need the other directory to be before <filename>/sw/sbin</filename>, then you'll want to temporarily rename the other <filename>install-info</filename> when you use fink.</p>

<faqentry name="bad-list-file" >
<question>
<p>I can't install or remove anything, because of a problem with a &quot;files list file&quot;.</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>Typically these errors take the form:</p>
<p>
<code>files list file for package <em>packagename</em> contains empty filename</code>
</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>
<code>files list file for package <em>packagename</em> is missing final newline</code>
</p>
<p>This can be fixed, with a little work.  If you have the .deb file for the offending package currently available on your system, then check its integrity by running</p>
<p>
<code>dpkg --contents <em>full-path-to-debfile</em>
</code>
</p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<p>
<code>dpkg --contents /sw/fink/10.2/unstable/main/binary-darwin-powerpc/gnome/libgnomeui2-dev_2.0.6-2_darwin-powerpc.deb</code>
</p>
<p>If you get back a listing of directories and files, then your .deb is OK.  If the output is something other than directories and files, or if you don't have the deb file, you can still proceed because the error doesn't interfere with builds.  Just use <code>fink rebuild <em>packagename</em>
</code>, to build the .deb--it won't install yet, though.</p>
<p>Once you have a valid .deb file, then you can reconstitute the file.  First become root by using <code>sudo -s</code> (enter your administrative user password if necessary), and then use the following command (on one line--it's split for readability here):</p>
<p>
<code># dpkg -c <em>full-path-to-debfile</em>
</code>
</p>
<p>
<code>| awk '{if ($6 == &quot;./&quot;){ print &quot;/.&quot;; } else if (substr($6, length($6), 1) == &quot;/&quot;)</code>
</p>
<p>
<code> {print substr($6, 2, length($6) - 2); } else { print substr($6, 2, length($6) - 1);}}' </code>
</p>
<p>
<code>> /sw/var/lib/dpkg/info/<em>packagename</em>.list</code>
</p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<p>
<code># dpkg -c /sw/fink/10.2/unstable/main/binary-darwin-powerpc/gnome/libgnomeui2-dev_2.0.6-2_darwin-powerpc.deb</code>
</p>
<p>
<code>| awk '{if ($6 == &quot;./&quot;) { print &quot;/.&quot;; } else if (substr($6, length($6), 1) == &quot;/&quot;)</code>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<code>> /sw/var/lib/dpkg/info/libgnomeui2-dev.list</code>
</p>

You've replaced the GNU version of the <code>make</code> utility

Many packages rely on special features only supported by GNU make.
Make sure that <code>/usr/bin/make</code> is a symlink to
<code>gnumake</code>, not <code>bsdmake</code>. Furthermore,
make sure that <code>/usr/local/bin/</code> does not contain another
copy of <code>make</code>.

<question>
<p>I'm getting a strange usage message

</question>
<answer>
<p>If you're seeing this:</p>
<codeblock>Unknown option: 1
Usage: head [-options] &lt;url>...</codeblock>
<p>followed by a list of option descriptions, you have a broken
<code>head</code> executable.
This happens when you install the Perl libwww library on an HFS+
system volume.
It tries to create a new command <code>/usr/bin/HEAD</code>, which
overwrites the existing <code>head</code> command because the file
system is case-insensitive.
<code>head</code> is a standard command used in many shell scripts and
Makefiles.
You need to get the original <code>head</code> executable back if you
want to use Fink.
</p>
<p>
The bootstrap script of the source release now checks for this, but
you can still run into it if you use the binary release for first-time
installation or install libwww after you installed Fink.

<faqentry name="cant-install-xfree" >
<question>
<p>I want to switch to fink's xfree86 packages, but I can't install xfree86-base, because it conflicts with system-xfree86.</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>XFree86, unfortunately, really needs to be installed in /usr/X11R6.  Because of this the fink <code>xfree86-base</code> and <code>xfree86-rootless</code> packages install there, too.  However, since fink won't remove any files that aren't in its database, it won't automatically replace a non-fink installation of XFree86.</p>
<p>
<em>Here's how to proceed:</em>
</p>
<p>1. Uninstall <code>xaw3d</code> and <code>xaw3d-shlibs</code> if you installed them with fink, and their version is 1.5-4 or earlier, because they also install in /usr/X11R6 (this is no longer the case for 1.5-5 and later versions).</p>
<p>2. Remove <code>system-xfree86</code>.  If you don't have any packages that depend on X11, this is straightforward.  Frequently, however, many packages that depend on X11 are installed.  Rather than uninstalling all of them, you can use</p>
<p>
<code>sudo dpkg --remove --force-depends system-xfree86</code>
</p>
<p>to remove it, leaving everything in place.  If you don't have <code>system-xfree86</code> installed then proceed to step 3.</p>
<p>3. Manually remove all of XFree86.  This can be done with</p>
<p>
<code>sudo rm -rf /Applications/XDarwin.app /usr/X11R6 /etc/X11</code>
</p>
<p>4. Install fink's <code>xfree86-base</code> and <code>xfree86-rootless</code> by the usual means:  &quot;<code>fink install</code>&quot; for source users, &quot;<code>apt-get install</code>&quot; or <code>dselect</code> for binaries.</p>
<p>5. If you had <code>xaw3d</code> and <code>xaw3d-shlibs</code> installed originally, then reinstall them (since some other package on your system likely depends on them).  If by some chance you installed them through other means than fink, install the fink packages.</p>

<faqentry name="change-thread-nothread" >
<question>
<p>How do I change from the non-threaded version of fink to the threaded version (or vice-versa)?</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>If you are running the fink version of XFree86 and you want to switch between the threaded and non-threaded versions of fink, you need to manually remove the old version. This is done at the command-line with the commands:</p>
<codeblock>
sudo dpkg -r --force-depends xfree86-base
sudo dpkg -r --force-depends xfree86-shlibs
sudo dpkg -r --force-depends xfree86-rootless
sudo dpkg -r --force-depends xfree86-rootless-shlibs
	</codeblock>
<p>or to delete the threaded versions:</p>
<codeblock>
sudo dpkg -r --force-depends xfree86-base-threaded
sudo dpkg -r --force-depends xfree86-shlibs-threaded
sudo dpkg -r --force-depends xfree86-rootless-threaded
sudo dpkg -r --force-depends xfree86-rootless-threaded-shlibs
	</codeblock>
<p>FinkCommander also has a way to remove packages. In the source window, select a package, and then in the <code>Source Menu</code> use &quot;<code>Force Remove</code>.&quot;</p>
<p>If you are using system-xfree86, see the previous question for removing it.</p>
<p>Install the version of xfree86 you want: </p>
<p>
<code>xfree86-base</code> and <code>xfree86-rootless</code>
</p>
<p>
<code>xfree86-base-threaded</code> and <code>xfree86-rootless-threaded</code>

<question>
<p>There are suddenly a number of 
strange users on my system, with names like &quot;mysql&quot;, &quot;pgsql&quot;, and &quot;games&quot;.  
Where did they come from?</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>
You have used Fink to install a package which is dependent on another package,
passwd.  passwd installs a number of extra users on your system for security 
reasons -- on Unix systems, files and processes belong to &quot;owners&quot;, which 
allows
system administrators to fine-tune the permissions and security of the system. 
 Programs such as Apache and MySQL need an &quot;owner&quot;, and it is insecure to 
assign these daemons to root (imagine what would happen if Apache were to be 
compromised and suddenly had write permission to all files on the system).  
Thus, the passwd package takes the work out of setting up these extra users 
for Fink packages that require this.</p>
<p>It can be alarming to suddenly discover a number of unexpected users in your
 &quot;System Preferences: Users&quot; pane, but suppress the urge to delete them:
</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, you have obviously chosen to install a package which requires
 their use, so deleting the user doesn't make much sense, does it?</li>
<li>There are in fact a number of extra users already installed on Mac OS X 
that you may not have known about:  www, daemon, nobody, are just a few of 
them.
The presence of these extra users is a standard Unix convention for running 
certain services; the passwd package simply adds a couple of extra that Apple 
did not provide.  You can see these Apple-installed users in NetInfo 
Manager.app, or by running
<code>niutil -list . /users</code>
</li>
<li>If you do decide to delete these users, be very careful of how you go about
 it.  Using the &quot;System Preferences: Users&quot; pane will assign all of their files
 to a random administrator account, and there have been reports of havoc played
 with the administrator account's permissions.  This is a bug with System 
Preferences, and has been submitted to Apple.  A safer way to remove these 
users from your system is to do so from within NetInfo Manager.app or use the 
command line tool <code>niutil</code> in Terminal.  Read the man page
 for <code>niutil</code> for more information about NetInfo.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fink <em>does</em> request permission to install these additional users on 
your system during the installation of the passwd package, so this should not 
have come as a surprise.

<faqentry name="compile-myself" >
<question>
<p>How do I compile something
myself using fink-installed software?</p>
</question>
<answer>
<!-- TODO: maybe change this to use LIBRARY_PATH / DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH ? --><p>When compiling something yourself outside of fink, the compiler and
linker need to be told where to find the fink-installed libraries and
headers. For a package that uses standard configure/make process, you
need to set the CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, and LDFLAGS environment
variables:
</p>
<codeblock>
setenv CFLAGS -I/sw/include
setenv LDFLAGS -L/sw/lib
setenv CXXFLAGS $CFLAGS
setenv CPPFLAGS $CXXFLAGS
</codeblock>
<p>
It is often easiest just to add these to your .tcshrc or .cshrc so they
are set automatically.
If a package does not use these variables, you may need to add the
&quot;-I/sw/include&quot; (for headers) and &quot;-L/sw/lib&quot; (for libraries) to the
compile lines yourself. Some packages may use similar non-standard
variables such as EXTRA_CFLAGS or --with-qt-dir= configure options.
&quot;./configure --help&quot; will usually give you a list of the extra configure
options.
</p>
<p>In addition, you may need to install the development headers (e.g. <em>foo-1.0-1-dev</em> for the library packages that you are using, if they aren't already installed.</p>

<answer>

Make sure you have the &quot;eSound Output Plugin&quot; selected in the XMMS
preferences.
For some strange reason, it selects the disk writer plugin as the
default.
</p>
<p>
If you still get no sound output or XMMS complains that it can't find
your sound card try this:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you haven't muted sound output in Mac OS X.</li>
<li>Run <code>esdcat /usr/libexec/config.guess</code> (or any other
file of a decent size).
If you hear a short noise, esound works and XMMS should work too if
it's configured correctly.
If you don't hear anything, esd isn't working for some reason.
You can try to start it up manually with <code>esd &amp;</code> and watch
the messages.
</li>
<li>
If it still doesn't work, check the permissions on
<code>/tmp/.esd</code> and <code>/tmp/.esd/socket</code>.
Those should have your normal user account as the owner.
If they aren't owned by you, kill esd if it's running, remove the
directory as root (<code>sudo rm -rf /tmp/.esd</code>), then start esd
again (as a normal user, not as root).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that esd is designed to be run by a normal user, not by root.
It usually communicates via the file system socket
<code>/tmp/.esd/socket</code>.
You only need the <code>-tcp</code> and <code>-port</code> switches if
you want to run esd clients on another machine over the network.

There have also been reports of XMMS crashing or freezing on 10.1.

<answer>
<p>
This is a known problem on 10.1.
You must use the &quot;Load from file&quot; keymapping option since the default
option (loading it from the kernel) doesn't work anymore.
The setting is in the XDarwin Preferences dialog.
Be sure that a file is selected (e.g. USA.keymapping) - simply
activating the check box may not be sufficient with some versions.
If you can't get to the Preferences dialog because you disabled all
splash screens, you can delete
<code>~/Library/Preferences/org.xfree86.XDarwin.plist</code> to get it
back, then start XDarwin and go to the Preferences dialog while the
splash screen is displayed.
Alternatively, you can edit that file manually in a text editor to
enable the keymapping option (the UseKeymappingFile and KeymappingFile
bits).
</p>
<p>
As a last resort, you can run <code>startx -- -quartz -keymap
USA.keymapping</code> from Terminal.app.
If this still doesn't work, you have another problem in addition to
the keymapping problem that prevents XDarwin from starting.
You'll get a bunch of diagnostic messages in Terminal.app to help you
sort this out.

<question>
<p>xterm fails with &quot;dyld: xterm Undefined symbols:  xterm undefined reference to _tgetent expected to be defined in /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib&quot;.</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>This is caused by using a 10.1 version of XFree86 on 10.2.  You must upgrade to a 10.2 version.</p>
<p>If you are using the fink <code>xfree86</code> packages, then you can get an upgrade by the usual means (&quot;<code>fink selfupdate-cvs ; fink update-all</code>&quot; for installation from source, <code>fink selfupdate ; ; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade</code>&quot; for installation from binaries.</p>
<p>If you have installed XFree86 by other means, you can find patches to bring you up to date at the <link url="http://mrcla.com/XonX" >XonX web site</link>.</p>

<p>When I try to start XFree86 I get one of the following errors:  &quot;dyld: xinit can't open library: /usr/X11R6/lib/libXmuu.1.dylib&quot; or &quot;dyld: xinit can't open library:  /usr/X11R6/lib/libXext.6.dylib&quot;</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>
You are missing a file that is supposed to be installed by <code>xfree86-rootless-(threaded)-shlibs</code>.  You should reinstall it using <code>fink reinstall xfree86-rootless-shlibs</code> (<code>fink reinstall xfree86-rootless-threaded-shlibs</code> if you are using the threaded XFree86 packages) for source, or <code>sudo apt-get install --reinstall xfree86-rootless-shlibs</code> for binaries.</p>

<faqentry name="apple-x-bugs" >
<question>
<p>I had Fink's XFree86 installed, and I've replaced it with Apple's X11, and now everything's crashing!</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>
  First of all, if you previously had the &quot;threaded&quot; versions of Fink's XFree86 packages installed, you may need to rebuild the application that is crashing.  Some programs check for the availability of threading at build time, and then from then on believe that threading is available to them.
 </p>
<p>
  Secondly, you may have just hit an Apple X11 bug.  As of the time of this writing, a number of bugs are known by the Apple team and are being worked on.
 </p>
<p>
  If you have general questions regarding Apple's X11 that are not really related to Fink, you may want to check <link url="http://www.lists.apple.com/x11-users" >Apple's official discussion list on X11</link>. They also have also recommended that bugs in X11 be <link url="http://developer.apple.com/bugreporter" >submitted to the Apple bug reporter</link>.

<faqentry name="apple-x-delete" >
<question>
<p>I want the delete key in Apple's X11.app to behave like that in XDarwin.</p>
</question>
<answer>
<p>Some users have reported that the behavior of the <code>delete</code> key is different between XDarwin and Apple X11.  This can be rectified by adding lines to the appropriate X startup files:</p>
<p>
<em>.Xmodmap:</em>
</p>
<codeblock>keycode 59 = Delete</codeblock>
<p>
<em>.Xresources:</em>
</p>
<codeblock>
xterm*.deleteIsDEL: true
xterm*.backarrowKey: false
xterm*.ttyModes: erase ^?
</codeblock>
<p>
<em>.xinitrc</em>
</p>
<codeblock>xrdb -load $HOME/.Xresources
xmodmap $HOME/.Xmodmap</codeblock>
