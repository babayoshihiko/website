 <headline>fink-0.39.0 released</headline>
 <body>
  <p>The Fink Project has released <code>fink-0.39.0</code> to support OS X El Capitan 
  (10.11).  
  This release also switches the distribution tree used by fink on 10.9 and 10.10.  
  The best update sequence from going to 10.9 or 10.10 to 10.11 is as follows:</p>
  <p>0) Start on 10.9 or 10.10.</p>
  <p>1) fink cleanup --deb</p>
  <p>2) fink selfupdate</p>
  <p>3) fink selfupdate</p>
  <p>4) Update to 10.11</p>
  <p>If you happen to have updated your OS X before updating Fink, you can download a
  <link url="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/fink/fink_0.39.0-101_darwin-x86_64.deb">
  .deb  archive</link> , and install it using 
  <code>sudo dpkg -i fink_0.39.0-101_darwin-x86_64.deb</code> from the directory where 
  you downloaded it.

 <headline>fink-0.38.5 released.</headline>
 <body>
  <p>
  <code>fink-0.38.5</code> was released on 14 May, 2015.  This release enables
  official OS X 10.10.3 support, and reverts a change made in <code>fink-0.38.4</code>
  to restore the requirement that the /usr/X11R6 convenience symlink be present for
  the <code>x11*</code> virtual packages to be active.
  </p>
  <p>
  It also downgrades building libraries with flat namespace from a fatal validation
  error to a warning, since some packages require such a build.  There are a number
  of additional validation enhancements as well.  Check the commit logs on fink's 
  github site for additional information.

  </p>
  <p>
  10.9 users who want to upgrade their Fink installations in place from 10.9 to 10.10
  may do so.  To do so, you must install <code>fink-0.38.0</code> (or later) on 10.9 
  before updating to 10.10.  We don't support upgrading Fink on 10.8 or earlier to 10.10.

 <body>
  <p>
  <code>fink-0.37.0</code> and <code>fink-0.37.0</code> were released on 4 June, 2014.
  These <code>fink</code> releases contain fixes for Java detection on 10.6 if older
  versions of Apple's Java SDK are installed.  <code>fink-0.37.0</code> officially 
  recognizes OS 10.9.3.  In addition, Fink's compiler wrappers are 
  now installed directly by the fink package to make for easier modifications.
  </p>
  <p>
  <code>fink-0.36.5</code> marks the end of 10.6 support by the Fink Project.  Users
  who want package updates should contact the maintainers of the respective packages.

 <headline>fink-0.36.4 released</headline>
 <body>
  <p>
  <code>fink-0.36.4</code> was released on 6 April, 2014.
  This <code>fink</code> release restores the use of an official binary distribution by
  default on 10.8 and 10.9 (if distributions are created for 10.6 and 10.7
  those will be supported, too).  In addition, it works around the multiple
  build failures introduced by Xcode 5.1 on 10.8 and 10.9. This release also includes 
  official support for OS X 10.9.2, fixes the bootstrap operation when Xcode.app isn't
  present, and makes x86_64 the default architecture for 10.6 bootstraps.
  </p>
  <p>Users are encouraged to run <code>fink selfupdate</code> to install this version of
  fink, particularly in view of the Xcode 5.1 build issues.</p>

  <p>
  <code>fink-0.36.1</code> was released on 17 November, 2013.
  This release fixes an intermittent bug in building Perl modules
  which was introduced with fink-0.36.0.  We encourage our users to

  problems with installing a Perl module, use <code>fink rebuild</code>
  on it.

  <p>
  In addition, the bootstrap  script now validates whether the Mavericks 
  command-line build tools are installed on that OS version, and prevents 
  folks from bootstrapping with the wrong tools.

    <headline>Fink and Lion--updated.</headline>
    <body>
      <p>OS X 10.7 "Lion" was released on July 20, 2011.  We want to let Fink
      users know what to expect if updating.</p>
<p>First, the <code>fink</code> 
program itself will not run  on a system which has
been upgraded to Lion.  However, it will be possible to use the
<code>dpkg</code> program to extract a list of the Fink packages
which had been installed under 10.6, so that they can be reinstalled
under 10.7.  Use</p>
<p><code>dpkg --get-selections | cut -f1 > fink_packages.txt</code></p>
<p>to extract the packages, and</p>
<p><code>cat fink_packages.txt | xargs fink install</code></p>
<p>once you have installed Fink for 10.7.</p>
<p>To upgrade Fink after upgrading to Lion, one will have to bootstrap
Fink again, using a tarball for <code>fink-0.31.0</code> or later.</p>
<p>Second, due to lots of changes under the hood, there currently are many fewer
Fink packages which build under 10.7 as opposed to 10.6.
Thus, even if you've extracted a list of Fink packages which had
been installed under 10.6, some of them may not yet be installable under
10.7.  We are currently creating a database showing which packages
can be successfully installed under 10.7, and work is ongoing to add packages.</p>
<p>10.7 introduces several drastic changes to how the system works. While this may
cause a slight delay in full Fink functionality in the short term, it will
make Fink work better in the future.</p>

<p>(To upgrade fink after upgrading to Lion, one will have to bootstrap

      <p>We are experiencing a temporary failure in some of the rsync mirrors.
      If you have not seen updates in a while, then you may wish to change your
      rsync mirror for the time being by editing <code>/sw/etc/fink.conf</code> as a superuser
      and replacing the line that starts with <code>Mirror-rsync</code> with
        <code>Mirror-rsync: rsync://fink.gecko.ig42.org/finkinfo/</code></p>

    <headline>Happy 10th Birthday to Fink!</headline>
    <body>
      <p>The Fink project was started in the waning days of December 2000 by
Christoph Pfisterer, using the "public beta" release of Mac OS X.
Within a year, versions 10.0 and 10.1 of OS X had been released, and
Fink usage took off.  Our founder chrisp stepped away from the project
in November 2001, and the community took over.</p>
<p>The Fink community is the heart of Fink, involving both package maintainers
and Fink users, as well as the small core team which tries to keep the
overall system in good shape.  The success of this community in keeping
Fink viable and active over ten years is really quite remarkable!  Let's
all join together to keep Fink going for a long time to come.</p>
<p>How long?  In the memorable words of Buzz Lightyear: <code>To Infinity
and Beyond!</code></p>

    <headline>Fink no OS X 10.6</headline>
    <body>
      <p>O Fink está pronto para ser usado no Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6). Os
      usuários precisam escolher dentre a versão do Fink de 32 bits e a de 64
      bits para o 10.6. A versão de 32 bits possui mais pacotes disponíveis no
      momento mas a versão de 64 bits representa a direção futura tanto do OS X
      quanto do Fink; os usuários precisam fazer a escolha por conta própria.
      <em>Não</em> será possível fazer uma atualização de 32 bits para 64 bits
      (ou vice-versa) sem que o Fink seja completamente reinstalado.</p>
      <p>No presente momento, dois métodos estão disponíveis para instalar o
      Fink no Snow Leopard. Um instalador binário não está disponível,
      portanto é importante <em>instalar primeiro o Xcode da pasta Optional
      Installs no disco do Snow Leopard.</em> Usuários que queiram a versão de
      64 bits ou que estejam atualizando diretamente do OS X 10.4 ou anteriores
      devem instalar o Fink do zero a partir da tarball de distribuição (versão
      0.29.9 ou posteriores) disponível no <link
      url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fink/files/fink/0.29.9/fink-0.29.9.tar.gz/download">sourceforge.net</link>;
      as instruções de instalação estão <varlink
      url="download/srcdist.php">aqui</varlink>. Por outro lado, os usuários
      podem atualizar diretamente do OS X 10.5 para a versão de 32 bits
      seguindo as instruções abaixo. (Aviso: usuários que tenham instalado uma
      versão de desenvolvimento do Fink a partir do CVS no lugar de uma versão
      efetivamente lançada podem encontrar problemas; por favor, antes de
      começar, mude para uma versão oficialmente lançada e remova os arquivos
      .deb que possuam versões maiores.)</p>
      <p>Para fazer a atualização, siga os quatro passos a seguir. <em>Passo
      1:</em> edite o arquivo <code>/sw/etc/fink.conf</code> e adicione uma
      linha contendo <code>NoAutoIndex: true</code> (talvez você tenha que usar
      o <code>sudo</code> para obter as permissões corretas para editar o
      arquivo.) <em>Passo 2:</em> execute o comando <code>fink reinstall
      fink</code> para dizer ao Fink que agora você está no OS X 10.6.
      (Caso encontre uma mensagem sobre corrupção do banco de dados de pacotes,
      execute o comando <code>fink index -f</code> e tente este passo
      novamente.) <em>Passo 3:</em> execute o comando <code>fink update
      fink</code> para obter a última versão do Fink para o OS X 10.6.
      <em>Passo 4:</em> execute o comando <code>fink install
      perl588-core</code> para substituir a versão do Perl que foi alterada
      pela Apple durante a atualização do OS X caso você possua pacotes que
      dependam dele.</p>
      <p>Depois da atualização, talvez você queira executar o comando
      <code>fink configure</code> para fazer uma limpeza.</p>
      <p>Quase todos os pacotes do Fink na árvore stable vão compilar no OS X
      10.6 mas esteja ciente de que apenas uma fração dos pacotes do 10.5 estão
      disponíveis para o 10.6. Em um futuro próximo, o banco de dados de
      pacotes do Fink será atualizado para que inclua informações sobre pacotes
      para o 10.6; você poderá consultá-lo para verificar se seus pacotes
      prediletos estão disponíveis.</p>

    <body>
      <p>O projeto Fink não pode mais oferecer suporte a usuários do Fink no
      Mac OS X 10.3. Na verdade tem havido pouco suporte por algum tempo então
      este anúncio simplesmente formaliza esse fato.</p>
      <p>Isto significa que não haverá atualizações futuras, nem mesmo de
      segurança, para usuários do Mac OS X 10.3. Suas instalações atuais
      continuarão a funcionar mas o software que estiver instalado não será
      atualizado.</p>
      <p>Acreditamos que a maioria dos nossos usuários estejam usando Mac OS X
      10.4 ou 10.5 e esperiamos que esta decisão não seja inconveniente a
      muitas pessoas.</p>

    <headline>Migração em passa de pacotes.</headline>
    <body>
      <p>A atualização massiva do GNOME que esteve em andamento por várias
      meses foi incorporada à árvore unstable. Os pacotes foram bem testados e
      as atualizações feitas por usuários aparentam estar ocorrendo
      tranquilamente.</p>
      <p>Estamos agora incorporando a atualização do GNOME à árvore stable.
      Devido ao fato de não termos podido testar antecipadamente as
      dependências desses novos pacotes, os usuários podem esperar que a árvore
      stable não esteja tão estável durante as próximas semanas, enquanto os
      erros serão corrigidos.</p>
      <p>Se você está ansioso para usar imediatamente essa atualização massiva
      do GNOME, sugerimos que mude para a árvore unstable. Caso não queira,
      sugerimos que suspenda a execução de "fink selfupdate" por algum tempo
      (talvez uma semana ou duas) até que tudo esteja estabilizado
      novamente.</p>

    <headline>Nova versão do Fink.</headline>
    <body>
      <p>Uma nova versão (binária) do Fink para o OS X 10.5 (Leopard) está
      <varlink url="download/index.php">disponível</varlink> a partir de hoje:
      versão 0.9.0, a qual pode ser instalada em hardware Intel ou PowerPC.
      Esta versão inclui códigos fontes, pacotes de binários e instaladores do
      Fink para ambos os tipos de hardware.</p>
      <p>Usuários que já tenham instalado o Fink no Leopard a partir do código
      fonte e que queiram mudar para a distribuição de binários podem fazer o
      seguinte. Em primeiro lugar, execute <code>fink selfupdate</code> para
      atualizar para a última versão do gerenciador de pacotes fink. Em
      seguida, execute <code>fink configure</code> e assegure-se de
      <em>mudar</em> sua escolha sobre usar a distribuição de binários de Não
      para Sim. Finalmente, execute <code>fink scanpackages</code> para ativar
      a distribuição de binários.</p>
      <p><em>Atualização, 2008-07-11:</em> se você usa o instalador binário,
      você precisa executar <code>fink selfupdate</code> após a instalação.</p>
