    <headline>July is "Fink Update Month"</headline>
    <body>
      <p>
Fink users on PowerPC machines are advised to update their copies of
fink from the old "10.4-transitional" tree to the more recent "10.4"
tree.  We plan to discontinue the 10.4-transitional tree
by the end of July, 2006.
</p><p>
Some background: along with OS X 10.4 came a new version of the g++ compiler
(one of the workhorses of Fink), which produced code that was binary
incompatible with previous versions.  Fink, when using the 10.4-transitional 
tree, mixes the new gcc-4.0 compiler with the older g++-3.3 compiler.
This strategy gave us some extra time to make packages compatible with
g++-4.0.  The time has now come to complete that transition, and rely
exclusively on the newer tree.  The update, however, is slightly
complicated since all packages using or providing g++ libraries must
be rebuilt in the correct order.
</p><p>
If you are using OS X 10.4, you can
find out if you need to update your Fink installation
by running the command
<code>fink --version</code>.  If the Distribution version is 0.8.1.cvs
or 0.8.1.rsync, you do <em>not</em> need to update.  However, if the 
Distribution version is 0.8.0.cvs or 0.8.0.rsync, you should update,
as described below.
</p>
<p>
Many users will prefer to remove their fink installations and
start anew with the 0.8.1 installer.  Others will prefer to use the 
<link 
url="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/fink/scripts-10.4-update-0.4.tar.gz?download">10.4-update 
tarball (v. 0.4)</link> (around 12 MB), which includes 
precompiled versions of the basic fink packages as well as a script which
will attempt to update an existing fink installation.  Please consult
the README file which you will find within the 10.4-update directory 
(after unpacking the tarball) for further instructions.
</p>
<p>
Note: Fink users who are upgrading their systems from OS X 10.3 to OS X 10.4
can use the same two options to update their fink installations: they can
either remove their old fink installations and start over, or they can
use the same 10.4-update tarball.  The update script should not be run
until after OS X has been upgraded.

    <headline>New Fink release.</headline>
    <body>
      <p>
A new Fink release for OS X 10.4 (Tiger) is 
<varlink url="download/index.php">available</varlink>
 today: version 0.8.1, which can be installed on either Intel or PowerPC
hardware.
The release includes source files, binary packages, and  Fink
installers for both kinds of hardware.
</p>
      <p>
Fink on the Intel platform is still considered "beta" quality, and a number of
packages (particularly packages in the "unstable" tree) either do not compile,
or compile but do not run.  Work to improve this situation is ongoing.
</p>
<p>
Fink users on PowerPC whose existing fink installation uses the 
10.4-transitional tree (from the 0.8.0 distribution) may upgrade in
one of two ways.  The upgrade process is problematic, due to the change
in ABI of g++ libraries which requires many libraries to be recompiled.
Many users will simply wish to remove their fink installations and
start anew with the 0.8.1 installer.  Others may wish to use the new
<link url="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/fink/scripts-10.4-update-0.3.tar.gz?download">10.4-update tarball (v. 0.3)</link> (around 12 MB), which includes 
precompiled versions of the basic fink packages as well as a script which
will attempt to update an existing fink installation.

    <headline>CVS Troubles</headline>
    <body>
      <p>
As many Fink users are aware, the Fink CVS repository at sourceforge.net
has not been fully functional since March 30.  The anonymous CVS access
has not been updated since then, and as of several days ago, the developers
are also unable to update CVS in any form.
</p><p>
As we understand the current plans of sourceforge's staff (outlined
briefly on their <link 
url="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=2352&amp;group_id=1">site
status page</link>), the old CVS servers will never be brought back in
their current form.  This is likely to mean disruption for fink users,
but at present, we cannot say what form this disruption will take.
</p><p>
Our current advice to fink users is to switch to the 'rsync' method of
updating (by running the command 'fink selfupdate-rsync').  This will at
least give you a fink installation which is current up through May 7.
If a full update to the new CVS situation turns out to be impossible
via fink's normal selfupdate command, we will post instructions here
on how to update when they become available.
</p>
<p>Update 5/24/06: CVS is now functioning again, and users using the rsync
method of selfupdating are getting up-to-date content.  If you are using
the cvs method, and can't (or don't wish to) switch to rsync, you should
download the file <code>fink-mirrors-0.24.15.2.tar.gz</code> from <link
url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203&amp;package_id=69685">the
Sourceforge file release page</link>, expand the file, and run the command
<code>./inject.pl</code> from within the <code>fink-mirrors-0.24.15.2</code> directory.  After this has been done, the <code>fink selfupdate</code> command
should again work normally.

    <headline>Problem with Apple's latest Security Update</headline>
    <body>
      <p>
The Fink team has received reports of problems with the <code>rsync</code>
program which was modified by Apple's new Security Update 2006-001: for some
users, <code>fink selfupdate</code> fails to function after the Security
Update.  (The underlying cause appears to be a problem with the 
<code>--delete</code> option for <code>rsync</code>.)
</p>
      <p>
As a workaround, users can run <code>fink install rsync</code> to use
fink's rsync package rather than the Apple program.  Or, for those users
who need specific features of the Apple program (such as support for
Extended Attributes), another workaround is <code>fink selfupdate-cvs</code>
to switch from rsync to cvs updating.  
</p>
      <p>
This news item will be updated as the situation changes.
</p>
<p>Update 3/13/06: This has been resolved by security update 2006-002,
<link url="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303453">according
to Apple's documentation</link>.

<headline>Preliminary version of Fink on Intel</headline>
<body>
<p>
A preliminary version of Fink for the Intel architecture is now ready.
No binary packages are available, and things are still rough around
the edges, but it should be usable if you are patient!
</p>
<p>
To install, you need to get the file <code>fink-0.24.12.tar.gz</code>
from <link
url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203&amp;package_id=13043">the
Sourceforge file release page for Fink</link>, expand the file, and
run the command <code>./bootstrap.sh</code> .  At the end of the
bootstrap process, run <code>fink selfupdate</code> and you'll get
the currently available packages.
</p>
<p>
At last check, there were about 1750 packages in the "stable" tree, but
about 150 of those did not build.  When things are truly stable, another
annoucement will be made here.

<headline>Fink ready for XCode 2.2 (but not for Intel).</headline>
<body>
<p>
Fink is now ready for XCode 2.2, with the exception of the openoffice.org 
packages (which are expected to function again when we switch to the 10.4
tree).  Users are encouraged to upgrade to XCode 2.2 whenever they wish;
XCode 2.2 will be required for running the 10.4 tree when it is released.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, in spite of today's announcements from Apple, Fink is
not ready to run on Intel processors.  The Fink team hopes to have an
Intel-ready version of fink released within a few weeks; the Fink team does 
not advise early recipients of new iMacs to install Fink on them, but suggests
waiting until the new version of fink is ready.
</p>
<p>Fink package maintainers please take note of the new <code>Architecture</code> field, now documented in the packaging manual.

<headline>XCode 2.2 (10.4 only).</headline>
<body>
<p>
The Fink team has had reports of some build problems with the XCode 2.2 compilers.  Until these are sorted out, we recommend that users hold off on upgrading XCode.
</p>
<p>
For those who have already installed XCode 2.2 and don't want to revert to 2.1, your participation in the effort to find packages that don't work and to fix them so that they do is welcomed!

<headline>New Fink releases.</headline>
<body>
<p>
Three new Fink releases are 
<varlink url="download/index.php">available</varlink>
 today: version 0.8.0 (for 10.4),
version 0.7.2 (for 10.3), and version 0.6.4 (for 10.2).
All three releases include source files, binary packages, and a Fink
installer for new users.
</p>
<p>
The new release for 10.4 includes all currently-available "stable" packages
in source and binary form: there are 1565 of these, which constitutes more
than 80% of the 1909 packages available in the 10.3 release.  Work continues
by the fink developers on bringing more of the stable packages to Tiger.
</p>
<p>
The new release for 10.2 will be the last official release for that
version of Mac OS X.  Although no further updates (not even security
updates) will be provided by the Fink team, we anticipate that the
0.6.4 release will be usable for years to come.
</p>
<p>
Users upgrading to 10.4 can now simply issue a 
<code>fink selfupdate</code> command, followed by
<code>sudo /sw/lib/fink/postinstall.pl</code> (for first-time updaters
on 10.4), <code>fink scanpackages</code> and <code>sudo apt-get update</code>.
We don't recommend bootstrapping at the moment, since bootstrapping does
not work with the newly-released XCode 2.1 from Apple.
</p>
<p>
Note added 6/19/05: If the Fink-0.8.0 binary installer complains that the
volume does not support symlinks, try launching Disk Utility (from the 
Utilities folder inside the Applications folder), selecting the 
problematic volume and clicking on &quot;repair disk permissions.&quot;  
Also, the installer requires you to have administrative privileges, so be 
sure that you're running it as such a user.
</p>
<p>
Note added 6/30/05:  To avoid contamination with obsolete headers and 
the like, we recommend that people who want to build packages from source 
should perform a clean install of XCode via running the 
<code>/Developer/Tools/uninstall-devtools.pl</code> script.  For best 
results, you may want to do this before updating your OS.

<headline>Fink 和 Tiger</headline>
<body>
<p>
Fink 可以在 OS X 10.4 中使用！ 你可以有几种升级的方法：
</p><ul>
<li>
在最近的几周内，将会有一个安装包发布，提供给那些只使用二进制安装包的用户。
</li><li>
对于那些使用稳定代码树的用户，我们推荐使用 <code>sudo rm -Rf /sw</code> 命令先删除当前的 fink,
然后使用 <varlink 
url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203&amp;package_id=13043&amp;release_id=323774">
fink-0.23.9.tar.gz</varlink> fink-0.23.9 版本的源代码用 bootstrap 的方式安装。你首先需要从
上面链接下载源代码文件，然后用
<code>tar -xvzf fink-0.23.9.tar.gz</code> 命令解包。在解压后生成的 
<filename>fink-0.23.9</filename> 文件夹中运行
<code> ./bootstrap.sh </code> 命令，
然后你需要运行 <code>fink selfupdate</code> 做进一步更新。
</li><li>
对于那些使用未稳定代码树的用户，如果你的版本低于 0.24.5，你可以运行 
<code>fink selfupdate</code> 来安装 fink-0.24.5。在升级到 10.4 
完成后，首先用 <code>fink --version</code> 命令来检查你是不是已经升级到正确的版本。
如果你的版本低于 0.24.5，那么你可以用 <code>fink selfupdate</code> 来获得正确的版本。
然后你可以用 <code>fink reinstall fink</code> 来重新安装 fink 软件包，在这之后再用 
<code>fink selfupdate</code> 做进一步的更新。
</li>
</ul>
<p>目前，并非全部软件包都可以在 10.4 上运行，
但这种情况会在将来的几周内获得改善，稳定代码树中软件包的数量会比 10.3 中的明显地少，
但他们应该都可以编译通过。
</p>
<p>当然，还要一些小的细节问题需要完善。
我们鼓励使用 Fink 中软件做为关键应用的用户加入到邮件列表中，以在升级前可以了解其它人时候曾经碰到过问题。

	<headline>Problems with XCode 1.5</headline>
	<body>
	<p>
	In the past few days, there have been reports that some fink packages 
	do not compile correctly using XCode 1.5.  If you have not already
	upgraded to XCode 1.5, we suggest that you wait until this issue
	is resolved before doing so.
	</p><p>
	If you are having problems with a package which compiled under
	XCode 1.2 but does not compile correctly under XCode 1.5, 
	please report the package to
	the fink-devel mailing list.  (The usual symptom is: some symbols
	are  missing after compiling with g++.)  
	Packages already known to have this problem include
	octave, singular-factory, singular-libfac, and possibly sdl.

	<p>
	The fink-0.22.0 package manager, which was available briefly in the 
	unstable tree this past week, had a bug which prevents further
	updating via rsync.  If you installed this version of fink, you
	can recover by running the command 
	<code>fink install fink-0.21.2-1</code> which will downgrade fink
	to the version in the stable tree, and subsequently running
	<code>fink selfupdate</code>
	</p><p>
	If for any reason those commands don't work, go to 
	<link url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203">the 
	fink file release page at sourceforge</link> and download the
	file <code>fink-0.22.1.tar.gz</code> (or a more recent, i.e.,
	higher numbered, version).  Unpack this file with
	<code>tar xfz fink-0.22.1.tar.gz</code> , and then from within the
	fink-0.22.1 directory, run the command <code>./inject.pl</code>

	Fink's decision to gradually build its own network of mirrors
	has paid off. To make sure that we can continue to offer
	a high quality service we need to improve our mirror network.
	It has been some time since we last asked for more mirrors. 
	It is time to do so again. Fink is very grateful for the resources 
	granted to us by our community. To further improve our service to the 
	community we require an even better mirror system. We especially lack 
	mirrors in central Europe, Russia and the Far East. If you feel that 
	you have at least two Mbit to spare for a rsync mirror, or more to offer 
	a distfiles mirror, please <link url="mailto:mirrors@finkmirrors.net">contact us</link>.

	Thanks to the new Fink GNOME Core team, including a lot of hard work by packaging
	newcomer Keith Conger and GNOME 1.x maintainer Masanori Sekino, GNOME 2.4 has
	finally been released to the 10.3 unstable tree.
	</p>
	<p>
	It is there for the taking; please offer some of your time and test these packages
	if you are on unstable already.  Because of the massive number of changes, it is
	expected that there will be issues upgrading or installing the new GNOME.  If you

	<p>
	A happy new year to all of you from the whole team. Blame this outburst of an 
	attempt at slang language on some of us having to watch the MTV Music Awards all
   day long.
	</p>
	<p>
	Last year has been a good year for Fink. We have had hard times keeping up with 
	the changes introduces by Apple, but we also learned that we have a great community
	which is willing to go through great lengths to support us. 
	For this, we say &quot;Thank You&quot;. Much of what happens in the Fink project
   happens because of the amazing support and encouragement we get from our users.
	</p>
	<p>
	Two Zero Zero Four should not make us slow down, but speed up. There are some 
	interesting things in the pipeline, including GNOME 2.4, a new release of KDE, major 
	changes to the package manager itself, and organisational restructuring. 
	Hopefully we will advance into an even bigger project with developer conferences, 
	real life meetings, and a CD in your favourite shop.
	</p>
	<p>
	High ambitions can make one fall very deeply, thus we shall take it carefully, but 
	still we are all counting on your support during this year. Tell us what you think 
	about Fink; tell us what you like or dislike; show us ways to improve ourselves.
	Lend us your resources and sponsor a mirror or hardware. Devote some of your time
	to improve the package manager or add another piece of software by creating an
	info file. Browse this website and hopefully indulge yourself. We enjoy serving
	such a nice community; hopefully we shall make it a smooth ride for you and
	your Macintosh in Two Zero Zero Four.

	<p>While we welcome our latest full mirror in Norway, sponsored by Havar Valeur, 
        we crave more. To improve our service to all of you, we would like to ask that
        you evaluate carefully if you maybe do have the resources to become a mirror. 
        </p>    
        <p>     
        All it takes is a 10Mbit link, around 100MB of disk space  and some bandwidth you are 
        willing to share for Fink. The exact setup instructions for rsync mirrors can be found 
        <link url="http://finkmirrors.net/rsync.html">here</link>. Especially mirrors in
        Asia, Australia, New Zealand, South Europe and Middle Europe are welcome, since we have none in 
        those regions yet. If you feel generous and wish to donate even more resources, please visit
        <link url="http://finkmirrors.net">finkmirrors.net</link> to learn about your options.

        The current status of all available rsync mirrors can be viewed on the finkmirrors.net pages as well.
        We hope to improve this service in the future, yet this depends on your willingness to help us out.

	<headline>Fink 0.6.2 released</headline>
	<body>
        <p>The latest Fink release, version 0.6.2, is now available
for both source and binary users.  This is a bug-fix release, intended
to address two problems: the dselect/user deletion bug, and a 
problem with ownership of files.  The dselect bug was addressed by
updating the fink, dpkg, and apt packages.  After updating to 0.6.2,
it is safe to once again use dselect.  However, if you ran dselect
at any time since 0.6.0, you should carefully check the integrity
of the file at <code>/sw/etc/apt/sources.list</code>.  If you have
any doubts about this file, you should replace it with
<varlink url="files/sources.list">the default sources.list file</varlink>.
</p>
<p>Users who have installed binary files from the 0.6.1 distribution
may find that certain files in their Fink installation are owned
by UID 2011 rather than by root.  To correct this problem,
run the command:</p>
<codeblock>sudo find /sw/ -user 2011 -exec chown root:admin {} \;</codeblock>
<p>This release, like the previous one, was built on OS X 10.2
using the gcc 3.3 compiler, and runs fine with some exceptions* on OS X 10.3.  Most Fink 
users who upgrade to 10.3 will continue to
want to only use the binaries from this
new distribution for now, while the Fink team continues to modify
Fink packages for 10.3.
</p>
<p>*Exceptions include: emacs, qt.

	<headline>User Deletion Bug/ Dselect Troubles</headline>
	<body>
<p><em>Quick Summary: DO NOT USE DSELECT,</em> and if you've used it,
check your /sw/etc/apt/sources.list file carefully.</p>
		<p>Users who have bootstrapped or installed Fink 0.5.3 or Fink 0.6.0
		on Mac OS X 10.3 could exhibit a problem where all users get deleted
		from the netinfo database, and you become unable to log in.
We believe that this problem can only occur if you've used dselect.</p>
		<p>If you are using Mac OS X 10.3, please be sure you're using the
		latest Fink version to avoid the issue.  To make sure you don't have
		upgrade problems, check your <code>/sw/etc/apt/sources.list</code>
		file.  You will need to modify it if it contains <code>deb</code>
		lines that point to "release" or "current" without a version number.
		In other words, if your <code>sources.list</code> file contains
		these lines:</p>
		<codeblock>deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download release main
deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download current main</codeblock>
		<p>...you should change them to this:</p>
		<codeblock>deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download 10.3/release main
deb http://us.dl.sourceforge.net/fink/direct_download 10.3/current main</codeblock>
		<p>We are working on updating the repository to make sure that even
		if you update you don't get the broken code, and to
repair dselect, but in the meantime,
		make sure your <code>sources.list</code> file has the correct entries.</p>
<p>Other users have experienced problems with dselect itself, particularly
complaints about a missing "darwin" package.  If you are running dselect
under 10.3 and you <em>don't</em> get this warning, then your 
<code>sources.list</code> file is likely to be corrupted and you should
repair it as above.

        <headline>Fink 0.6.1 released</headline>
                <body>
        <p>The latest Fink release, version 0.6.1, is now available
for both source and binary users.  This release was built on OS X 10.2
using the gcc 3.3 compiler, and runs well on OS X 10.3.  Most Fink
users who upgrade to 10.3 will want to only use the binaries from this
new distribution for now, while the Fink team continues to modify
Fink packages for 10.3.
</p><p>
If you wish to access the 
new binaries, use apt-get, dselect, or the binary mode of
FinkCommander.  Unless you are interested in helping the Fink team
to test packages which are compiled on 10.3, 
do not use the command-line <code>fink</code> program to do your
installations for the
next few weeks.
</p>
<p>The simplest way to upgrade a binary installation is to run
"sudo apt-get update".  Further details and
other issues related to upgrading Fink to 10.3 are addressed on the
<varlink url="download/10.3-upgrade.php">Special 10.3 upgrade page.</varlink>
</p><p>
Before using the latest version of
the command-line <code>fink</code> program 
under OS X 10.2, be sure to install the August2003gccUpdater, available
after free registration from connect.apple.com.

		Furthermore I would like to welcome our new mirrors to the Fink family.
		From Europe in Rijeka, Croatia a new full mirror joins us. This mirrors 
		has been sponsored by the <link url="http://mac.dir.hr/">Jabucnjak</link> Apple user group. 
		This is our first mirror in Europe, so I hope that more will be joining us

		</p>
		<p>
		Dave Schroeder from the <link url="http://mirror.services.wisc.edu/">University of

		A. J. Wright and <link url="http://sunsite.utk.edu/">SunSITE@UTK</link> are helping out with 
		another full mirror in the United states. 
		</p>
		<p>
		This raises our full mirror count to four and the rsync mirror count to 
		five. We are happy to have such a great community back us up, but I know 
		that more mirrors will join over time. I will not stop nagging you until
		Fink has its own mirror in every state of the USA. Yet, with such a 
		brilliant community backing us up, I am not too worried about not
		reaching my goal very soon.
		</p>

		Trick or treat! Our most wanted treat is more mirrors, so come forth

	<headline>Upgrade to gcc 3.3 and/or 10.3</headline>
		<body>
	<p>It is now possible to upgrade Fink to take full advantage of the gcc 3.3
compiler, or to use OS X 10.3 if you have that installed.  Binary packages
corresponding to these upgrades are not yet available, so if you make 
extensive use of binary packages you may wish to wait a few days before 
upgrading.
</p><p>
If you wish to perform this upgrade, and you had previously installed the
June 2003 Developer Tools update from Apple, you will need to install
the August 2003 Developer Tools update BEFORE you upgrade Fink.  Under
10.3, be sure to install XCode from the XCode disk before upgrading
Fink.
</p><p>
Running "fink selfupdate" should perform the upgrade for you.  The latest
version of the fink package manager will automatically detect which
version of OS X and which version of gcc you have installed, and will
adjust itself accordingly.
</p><p>
If you wish to do a fresh install of Fink on a 10.3 system, we recommend
<link url="http://fink.sourceforge.net/download/srcdist.php">bootstrapping from
source,</link> starting from fink-full-0.6.0.tar.gz available
on fink's <link
url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203">sourceforge 
download page.</link>  You'll need XCode for this as
well.
</p><p>
Also note that once you have Fink version 0.15.0 or higher, you do
not need to install system-xfree86 anymore.  Fink is
capable of automatically determining your system-xfree86 version if you
don't already have any fink x11 packages installed.  If you currently
have an old system-xfree86 package of any kind installed, please run the
following:
</p>
<codeblock>sudo dpkg -r --force-all system-xfree86 system-xfree86-42 \
system-xfree86-43; fink selfupdate; fink index</codeblock>
<p>
The Fink team is still working on getting Fink packages working under 10.3,
but many many packages already work.

<p>As announced in <link

advisory</link>, it has recently been discovered that
the ftp servers for GNU software were compromised back in March, 
although it is not believed that any of the source code housed there
was affected.
</p><p>
Fink relies on MD5 checksums when downloading software, and we have had
no reports of incorrect checksums in Fink packages.  The Free Software
Foundation is in the process of verifying the integrity of all of the
source code distributed from that ftp site.  As of this writing, the source
code for the following Fink packages have not yet been verified:
<code>autoconf2.54</code>,
<code>emacs21</code>,
<code>gprolog</code>,
<code>groff</code>,
<code>guile16</code>,
<code>help2man</code>,
<code>jwhois</code>,
<code>libtool14</code>,
<code>libosip1</code>,

<code>slib</code>.
It may be difficult to install those packages at present.

               <body>
<p><em>Quick Summary: DO NOT INSTALL THIS UPDATE.</em></p>
               <p>
Apple has released a patch to the December 2002 
Developer Tools which includes gcc 3.3,
their new compiler.
</p><p>
Fink does not yet support compiling with gcc 3.3.  In addition, it is important
not to "mix and match" between compilers:  all C++ code in fink packages
needs to be compiled
with the same compiler.
</p><p>
For this reason, the Fink team recommends that if you update your
Developer Tools with the new patch, you should be careful to run
<code>sudo gcc_select 3</code>
prior to any "fink build" or "fink install" commands.
</p>
<p><em>Update 30 June 2003:</em> A 
<link url="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=2680195&amp;forum_id=2056">problem
has now been detected</link> with
the new assembler program which the update installs, which may prevent
certain Fink packages from being compiled at all if you install this
update.  
</p>
<p><em>Generally, Fortran programs will break if you install the update;
the breakage does not stop by simply switching back to gcc 3.1.</em>
The Fink team is working on a workaround for this problem, but until it
is ready, if you need Fortran-related programs you should not install
the update.</p>

        <p>
        The Virex 7.2 package, currently being distributed free to all .Mac 
members, has a serious conflict with Fink.  <em>Fink users should not install 
Virex 7.2 under any circumstances.</em>
  Installing it after Fink is installed
will damage your Fink installation; installing it prior to Fink will make
it impossible to install Fink without damaging Virex.
</p><p>
This bug has been <link

	<headline>Apple X11 Library Warning</headline>
	<body>
	<p>
	While Apple's X11 works just fine with existing binaries, it
has a bug in the install name of the libraries that can cause some
software to build incorrectly, and will break forward-compatibility
with future X11 releases.
</p>
<p>
	Ben Hines has created a script (available <link url="http://fink.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/fink/fix-fink/install_name_fix.pl">here</link>) that you can use
that will fix the install_name entries in Apple's X11 libraries,
but it will not repair software you have already built against the
broken libraries.
</p>
<p><em>Update 11 February 2003:</em> This script is not needed with 
version 0.2 of Apple's X11.app which was released yesterday.

	<headline>Gnome, libpng, and the unstable tree</headline>
	<body>
	<p>
        A problem was uncovered today concerning the versions of imlib,
 libpng, and gnome in Fink's unstable tree.  The Fink team is hard at
 work addressing this problem.  As a workaround, users can downgrade
their imlib package to the stable version, "<code>fink install
 imlib-1.9.10-9</code>", until the problem is fixed.
</p><p>
   Many Fink users may be using Fink's unstable tree without being
fully aware of what this entails.  For a few months in the fall,
enabling the unstable tree was the only way to gain access to
 10.2-compatible versions of Fink packages.  
<em>That is no longer the case.</em>
Fink users who do not wish to help the Fink team with testing should
disable their unstable tree.  To do this, edit the file
<code>/sw/etc/fink.conf</code> and remove the items
 <code>unstable/main</code> and <code>unstable/crypto</code> from the
 <code>Trees</code> line.
	</p>
<p>The Fink team appreciates those users who are willing to stick with
the unstable tree, even when there are problems like today's, and provide
the team with prompt feedback.  This is a community effort and we
appreciate your participation.

  <p>
    Fink 0.5.0a for Mac OS X 10.2 is now complete. (Note: 0.5.0a is a final
    release, and replaces 0.5.0 which was never officially released.) This
    release includes over 700 
    binary packages for OS X 10.2 as well as over 1800 source packages of
    all kinds. 
  </p>
  <p>
      The source release and the binary installer are available now, as well as all binary packages. For information about upgrading, visit the <varlink url="download/upgrade.php">Upgrade Matrix</varlink>. 
  </p>
  <p>
  This release is for Mac OS X 10.2 only. 10.1 users should use Fink 0.4.1.

Users should update their XFree86 installations to version 4.2.1.1
for use with OS X 10.2.2.  If you are using system-xfree86, you
can get the new version from the <link
url="https://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=118483">XonX 
project</link>.  If you are using Fink's
xfree86 packages, you should update to xfree86-base-4.2.1.1-1 and
xfree86-rootless-4.2.1.1-1.  These packages are recent additions to
the 10.2/unstable tree; to gain access to them, you may need to run 
"fink selfupdate-cvs" and/or enable the unstable tree

  <headline>Don't reuse binary installer</headline>
  <body>
  <p>
  Users are cautioned to use the binary installer for Fink 0.4.1 <em>only
once</em> on a given machine.  Due to an apparent bug in Apple's
Installer.app program, attempting a second installation on the same
machine can result in permissions being altered in the machine's root
directory, in some cases leaving the machine in a non-bootable state.
</p><p> If Installer.app presents you with an "Upgrade" button rather
than an "Install" button when installing Fink 0.4.1, <em>do not proceed
any further!</em> </p>
<p>A new version of the binary installer for Fink 0.4.1 became available
on November 5.  The new version avoids
the problem of the machine not booting, but even with the new version,
users are advised to only "Install",
not "Upgrade."  (You can recognize the new version by its filesize of
12582912 bytes, while the old version had a filesize of 10541112 bytes.)

    This is the <em>last release for Mac OS X 10.1</em>. Future versions of Fink will <em>not</em> officially support Mac OS X 10.1 anymore, we are gearing all our efforts towards 10.2.
    </p>
    <p>
    At the same time, this release is not meant for Mac OS X 10.2. Fink 0.5.0. which is targeted for October, will be geared towards 10.2. In the meantime refer to the news item below on how to upgrade Fink for 10.2.

			A test version of the 10.2 updater for Fink is now available. The update process is somewhat complicated at the moment, but is explained in <varlink url="news/jaguar.php">step-by-step instructions for updating</varlink>.

			At the moment, approximately 800 out of 1150 Fink packages have been made ready for 10.2. However, virtually all of these packages are still being tested and have not yet been moved to the "stable" tree in the 10.2 section; moreover, binaries for 10.2 packages are not yet available.

  <headline>Mac OS X 10.2 / Jaguar</headline>
  <body>
    <p>
      During the last few weeks, we got a lot of emails asking whether Fink will work Mac OS X 10.2.
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer is: Yes, we will support 10.2. However, due to some
      major changes in this new OS version, we had to make a lot of adjustments both
      to the Fink tool itself and to many packages. The current binary distribution,
      0.4.0a, will only work partially on 10.2. We are working on an upgrade guide,
      as well as a new Fink release, to support 10.2.
    </p>
	<p>
	 If you upgrade your system to 10.2 before the official Fink update for 10.2 is ready,
	 many Fink packages built on 10.1 are going to work fine, but others need to be rebuilt.
	 Some packages need special changes to build on 10.2. Adding "unstable/main" to your
	 list of trees in /sw/etc/fink.conf (see also the <varlink url="faq/usage-fink.php#unstable">FAQ</varlink>)
	 will give you access to the latest versions of packages, many of which include important
	 fixes for 10.2.
	</p>
    <p>
     As of now, please do not email us asking about 10.2 support. If you can't wait,
     consult the <varlink url="lists/index.php">mailing list archives</varlink> instead.

  <headline>Bug in passwd package</headline>
  <body>
    <p>
      All Fink users are urged to update their <em> passwd </em> package to version 20020329 or newer. Older versions of the <em> passwd </em> package are affected by a bug which could lead to the loss of all data on your hard disk if you remove system users created by Fink manually from the system via System Preferences. (Removing them via the NetInfo tool is safe.) You can check the version of your passwd package by entering <em> dpkg -s passwd</em>. If your version is outdated, you can update to the current one in two ways: 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Via the binary distribution. First make sure you have the latest list of packages available: <em> sudo apt-get update</em>. Then you can perform the actual update: <em> sudo apt-get install passwd</em>. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Via the source distribution. First make sure you have the latest set of package descriptions: <em> fink selfupdate-cvs</em>. Then, update the passwd package: <em> fink update passwd</em> 
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      See <varlink url="faq/usage-general.php#passwd">Fink's FAQ, question 6.3,</varlink> for more information about the passwd package.
