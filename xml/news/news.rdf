  A new Upgrade Matrix is
  now available, for use in upgrading earlier versions of Fink to the
  current version, under either OS X 10.1 or OS X 10.2.  Users upgrading
  under 10.1 will be brought to Fink version 0.4.1a, while users
  upgrading under 10.2 will be brought to Fink version 0.5.0a.

  The Fink team is aware of the shortcomings of the current
  Upgrade Matrix page, which is inadequate for upgrading
to Fink 0.5.0a.  Please be patient as we construct
  a new version of that page, whose existence will be announced
  here.  In the meantime, some of you may wish to use the test version of the Jaguar updater which was
made available on 2002-09-08.

    Fink 0.5.0a for Mac OS X 10.2 is now complete. (Note: 0.5.0a is a final
    release, and replaces 0.5.0 which was never officially released.) This
    release includes over 700 
    binary packages for OS X 10.2 as well as over 1800 source packages of
    all kinds. 
  
  
      The source release and the binary installer are available now, as well as all binary packages. For information about upgrading, visit the Upgrade Matrix. 
  
  
  This release is for Mac OS X 10.2 only. 10.1 users should use Fink 0.4.1.

Users should update their XFree86 installations to version 4.2.1.1
for use with OS X 10.2.2.  If you are using system-xfree86, you
can get the new version from the XonX 
project.  If you are using Fink's
xfree86 packages, you should update to xfree86-base-4.2.1.1-1 and
xfree86-rootless-4.2.1.1-1.  These packages are recent additions to
the 10.2/unstable tree; to gain access to them, you may need to run 
&quot;fink selfupdate-cvs&quot; and/or enable the unstable tree

    <description>
  
  Users are cautioned to use the binary installer for Fink 0.4.1 only
once on a given machine.  Due to an apparent bug in Apple's
Installer.app program, attempting a second installation on the same
machine can result in permissions being altered in the machine's root
directory, in some cases leaving the machine in a non-bootable state.
 If Installer.app presents you with an &quot;Upgrade&quot; button rather
than an &quot;Install&quot; button when installing Fink 0.4.1, do not proceed
any further! 
A new version of the binary installer for Fink 0.4.1 became available
on November 5.  The new version avoids
the problem of the machine not booting, but even with the new version,
users are advised to only &quot;Install&quot;,
not &quot;Upgrade.&quot;  (You can recognize the new version by its filesize of
12582912 bytes, while the old version had a filesize of 10541112 bytes.)

    This is the last release for Mac OS X 10.1. Future versions of Fink will not officially support Mac OS X 10.1 anymore, we are gearing all our efforts towards 10.2.
    
    
    At the same time, this release is not meant for Mac OS X 10.2. Fink 0.5.0. which is targeted for October, will be geared towards 10.2. In the meantime refer to the news item below on how to upgrade Fink for 10.2.

			A test version of the 10.2 updater for Fink is now available. The update process is somewhat complicated at the moment, but is explained in step-by-step instructions for updating. We also have separate instructions to install Fink from scratch on 10.2. 
		
		
			At the moment, approximately 800 out of 1150 Fink packages have been made ready for 10.2. However, virtually all of these packages are still being tested and have not yet been moved to the &quot;stable&quot; tree in the 10.2 section; moreover, binaries for 10.2 packages are not yet available.

      During the last few weeks, we got a lot of emails asking whether Fink will work Mac OS X 10.2.
    
    
      The answer is: Yes, we will support 10.2. However, due to some
      major changes in this new OS version, we had to make a lot of adjustments both
      to the Fink tool itself and to many packages. The current binary distribution,
      0.4.0a, will only work partially on 10.2. We are working on an upgrade guide,
      as well as a new Fink release, to support 10.2.
    
	
	 If you upgrade your system to 10.2 before the official Fink update for 10.2 is ready,
	 many Fink packages built on 10.1 are going to work fine, but others need to be rebuilt.
	 Some packages need special changes to build on 10.2. Adding &quot;unstable/main&quot; to your
	 list of trees in /sw/etc/fink.conf (see also the FAQ)
	 will give you access to the latest versions of packages, many of which include important
	 fixes for 10.2.
	
    
     As of now, please do not email us asking about 10.2 support. If you can't wait,
     consult the mailing list archives instead.

      Yesterday version 0.10.0 of the Fink package manager was released to the unstable tree, along with version 1.6 of the base-files package. All Fink users which are using the unstable tree are recommended to update to this version. The easiest way to do so usually is to run 'fink selfupdate-cvs' which will automatically take care of updating these essential packages.
    
    
      Please report any problems you encounter with this version via our bug tracker.
    
    
      An overview of what changed since version 0.9.12 can be found here.

      All Fink users are urged to update their  passwd  package to version 20020329 or newer. Older versions of the  passwd  package are affected by a bug which could lead to the loss of all data on your hard disk if you remove system users created by Fink manually from the system via System Preferences. (Removing them via the NetInfo tool is safe.) You can check the version of your passwd package by entering  dpkg -s passwd. If your version is oudated, you can update to the current one in two ways: 
    
    
      
        Via the binary distribution. First make sure you have the latest list of packages available:  sudo apt-get update. Then you can perform the actual update:  sudo apt-get install passwd. 
      
      
        Via the source distribution. First make sure you have the latest set of package descriptions:  fink selfupdate-cvs. Then, update the passwd package:  fink update passwd 
      
    
    
      See Fink's FAQ, question 6.3, for more information about the passwd package.
