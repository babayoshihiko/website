As announced in this CERT 
advisory, it has recently been discovered that
the ftp servers for GNU software were compromised back in March, 
although it is not believed that any of the source code housed there
was affected.

Fink relies on MD5 checksums when downloading software, and we have had
no reports of incorrect checksums in Fink packages.  The Free Software
Foundation is in the process of verifying the integrity of all of the
source code distributed from that ftp site.  As of this writing, the source
code for the following Fink packages have not yet been verified:
autoconf2.54,
emacs21,
gprolog,
groff,
guile16,
help2man,
jwhois,
libtool14,
libosip1,
sed,
slib.
It may be difficult to install those packages at present.

    <title>Developer Tools Update.</title>
    <link>http://fink.sf.net/news/#2003-06-26%20Developer%20Tools%20Update.</link>
    <dc:date>2003-06-26</dc:date>
    <description>
Quick Summary: DO NOT INSTALL THIS UPDATE.
               
Apple has released a patch to the December 2002 
Developer Tools which includes gcc 3.3,
their new compiler.

Fink does not yet support compiling with gcc 3.3.  In addition, it is important
not to &quot;mix and match&quot; between compilers:  all C++ code in fink packages
needs to be compiled
with the same compiler.

For this reason, the Fink team recommends that if you update your
Developer Tools with the new patch, you should be careful to run
sudo gcc_select 3
prior to any &quot;fink build&quot; or &quot;fink install&quot; commands.

Update 30 June 2003: A 
problem
has now been detected with
the new assembler program which the update installs, which may prevent
certain Fink packages from being compiled at all if you install this
update.  

Generally, Fortran programs will break if you install the update;
the breakage does not stop by simply switching back to gcc 3.1.
The Fink team is working on a workaround for this problem, but until it
is ready, if you need Fortran-related programs you should not install
the update.

For the next six weeks everyone is invited to submit their logo creations. 
Fink needs a new face and with your help we might just get one.  We are curious to see what you imagine Fink to be as a graphical representation.
The initial announcement by Macnews is in German, for those of you not capable of reading German a translated version can be found
 here. 
                

Fink and Macwelt hope that many of you will participate as we might just find some prices for the winners. Good luck and.... start drawing.

	       McAfee has released Virex 7.2.1, which no longer
overwrites the main Fink directory /sw.  Fink users should
continue to avoid Virex 7.2.
Early reports indicate that upgrading Virex from 7.2 to 7.2.1
still leaves some problems however.  If you upgrade Virex with Fink not
installed, and subsequently
wish to install Fink, you will need to delete the /sw
directory by hand before installing.  And if you upgrade Virex with
Fink already installed, you should immediately run

fink reinstall openssl-shlibs dlcompat-shlibs curl-ssl-shlibs

to restore files which the Virex upgrade may have deleted.

        The Virex 7.2 package, currently being distributed free to all .Mac 
members, has a serious conflict with Fink.  Fink users should not install 
Virex 7.2 under any circumstances.
  Installing it after Fink is installed
will damage your Fink installation; installing it prior to Fink will make
it impossible to install Fink without damaging Virex.

This bug has been reported 
to Virex's manufacturer.  We will keep the
Fink community informed about the situation as it develops.

	While Apple's X11 works just fine with existing binaries, it
has a bug in the install name of the libraries that can cause some
software to build incorrectly, and will break forward-compatibility
with future X11 releases.


	Ben Hines has created a script (available here) that you can use
that will fix the install_name entries in Apple's X11 libraries,
but it will not repair software you have already built against the
broken libraries.

Update 11 February 2003: This script is not needed with 
version 0.2 of Apple's X11.app which was released yesterday.

    <description>
	
        A problem was uncovered today concerning the versions of imlib,
 libpng, and gnome in Fink's unstable tree.  The Fink team is hard at
 work addressing this problem.  As a workaround, users can downgrade
their imlib package to the stable version, &quot;fink install
 imlib-1.9.10-9&quot;, until the problem is fixed.

   Many Fink users may be using Fink's unstable tree without being
fully aware of what this entails.  For a few months in the fall,
enabling the unstable tree was the only way to gain access to
 10.2-compatible versions of Fink packages.  
That is no longer the case.
Fink users who do not wish to help the Fink team with testing should
disable their unstable tree.  To do this, edit the file
/sw/etc/fink.conf and remove the items
 unstable/main and unstable/crypto from the
 Trees line.
	
The Fink team appreciates those users who are willing to stick with
the unstable tree, even when there are problems like today's, and provide
the team with prompt feedback.  This is a community effort and we
appreciate your participation.

  Users are cautioned to use the binary installer for Fink 0.4.1 only
once on a given machine.  Due to an apparent bug in Apple's
Installer.app program, attempting a second installation on the same
machine can result in permissions being altered in the machine's root
directory, in some cases leaving the machine in a non-bootable state.
 If Installer.app presents you with an &quot;Upgrade&quot; button rather
than an &quot;Install&quot; button when installing Fink 0.4.1, do not proceed
any further! 
A new version of the binary installer for Fink 0.4.1 became available
on November 5.  The new version avoids
the problem of the machine not booting, but even with the new version,
users are advised to only &quot;Install&quot;,
not &quot;Upgrade.&quot;  (You can recognize the new version by its filesize of
12582912 bytes, while the old version had a filesize of 10541112 bytes.)
