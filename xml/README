IMPORTANT NOTE: As of 29 June 2003, the CVS modules have been somewhat
rearranged.  It is no longer advisible to check out the "web" module from
CVS.  If you want the website contents, check out the "website" module.
If you want to be able to edit the documentation, including the website,
check out the "xml" module.


 README for XML Documents
==========================

This directory and its subdirectories contain the XML source of the
various documents of the Fink project, plus various XSLT stylesheets
for rendering:

 * finkdoc-website.xsl renders to HTML for the website. The script
   postprocess.pl adds the required PHP wrapper. Multiple pages /
   files are generated for <document> documents.

 * finkdoc-html.xsl renders to pure, monolithic HTML for inclusion
   with the distribution and for printing.

 * finkdoc-text.xsl renders to ASCII text via an intermediary XML
   format. The textify.pl script does the actual text rendering. This
   is also for inclusion with the distribution.

To render the documents, you need xsltproc, available in the "libxslt"
package in Fink. You also need xmllint from the "libxml2" package in Fink.
You can then use the provided Makefiles to render the documents. There
are .cvsignore files to keep CVS from complaining about generated files.


From the XML files in this repository, we generate various documentation,
in various formats: HTML, PHP or plain text files, some monolingual and
some multilingual. To "compile" all XML files at once, simple type

   make

in the same directory this README is located in. You can also cd into
individual subdirectories and use "make" in them to build only that
particular part of the documentation.

Once you compile the documentation, it needs to be put into its final
destinations, i.e. "install" them. Now some parts of the generated
documentation is intended for hosting on the finkproject.org website;
some is to be shipped with the fink package manager; and some with the
fink installer.

In order for this "installation" to work, you need to make some
preparation. In particular, the "fink" and "scripts" git repositories
must be cloned and placed into the directory this README is in. If you
have not yet done that, you can clone these git repositories by
entering the following commands (you need to have "git" installed
for this, e.g. by installing the fink package of this name).

  git clone git@github.com:fink/fink.git
  git clone git@github.com:fink/scripts.git

If you already do have clones of the fink and scripts repository inside
the current directory, you may want to run "git pull" in each before
continuing, to ensure that you got the latest version of each. Once this
is done, you can type

  make install
  
which will copy the documentation you compiled earlier using "make" into
the appropriate subdirectories (currently these are inside web/, fink/
and scripts/).

Finally, you need to commit any updates you made.

TODO: Insert guide on how to do that using CVS (for the xml files, and web),
respectively using git (for fink and scripts). For CVS, it boils down to
  cvs commit -m "some useful description of your changes"
while for git it boils down to
  cd fink && git commit -a -m "some useful description of your changes" && git push
  cd scripts && git commit -a -m "some useful description of your changes" && git push
But in any case, committers should be cautioned to first use "cvs diff" resp. "git diff"
to inspect what they are about to commit.
