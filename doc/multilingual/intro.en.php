<h1>i18n - 1 Introduction</h1>
    

    

    <h2><a name="what">1.1 What is going on with internationalization of the Fink
      website?</a></h2>
      

      <p>The Fink project has undertaken an effort to add full
      internationalization support to its website, in order to make the site
      more accessible worldwide. Thanks to Baba Yoshihiko, there is now a
      framework in which pages in multiple languages can be employed</p>
    

    <h2><a name="languages">1.2 Languages</a></h2>
      

      <p>We currently have volunteers working on the following languages:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Danish</li>

        <li>Dutch</li>

        <li>English (the baseline documentation)</li>

        <li>French</li>

        <li>German</li>

        <li>Italian</li>

        <li>Japanese</li>

        <li>Spanish</li>

        <li>Simplified Chinese</li>
      </ul>
    

    <h2><a name="organization">1.3 Organization</a></h2>
      

      <p>A chart of the organization of the i18n team is available <a href="http://micmacfr.homeunix.org/web/organisation/">here</a>.</p>
    

    <h2><a name="helping">1.4 Helping out.</a></h2>
      

      <p>If you wish to help out with the internationalization effort, there
      are several things that you can do:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Join discussions on the <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/lists/fink-i18n.php">fink-i18n
        mailing list</a>. This is where we will discuss the mechanics of
        internationalization, announcements of updates to documents will be
        made, etc.</li>

        <li>Look over the translation for your own language. You may have a
        translation that flows better than does the official one, you may find
        a translation error, and other possibilities.</li>

        <li>Become a translator yourself. If your language isn't currently
        represented (or even if it is), and you think you can provide an
        effective translation, then you may want to volunteer to be a
        translator for your language. <p>Be advised, however, if you are the
        first person to work on your language: there are quite a few documents
        that you will have to translate initially. Once this is done, there
        typically will be small changes made.</p></li>
      </ul>
