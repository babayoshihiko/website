<h1>Running X11 - 6 Other X11 Possibilities</h1>




<a name="vnc"><h2>6.1 VNC</h2></a>
<p>
VNC is a network-capable graphics display system similar in design to
X11.
However, it works at a lower level, making implementation easier.
With the Xvnc server and a Mac OS X display client, it is possible to
run X11 applications with Mac OS X.
Jeff Whitaker's <a href="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/~jsw/macosx_xvnc/">Xvnc page</a> has
more information on that.
</p>



<a name="wiredx"><h2>6.2 WiredX</h2></a>
<p>
<a href="http://www.jcraft.com/wiredx/">WiredX</a> is an X11
server written in Java.
It also supports rootless mode.
An Installer.app package is available at the web site.
</p>



<a name="exodus"><h2>6.3 eXodus</h2></a>
<p>
According to the website, <a href="http://www.powerlan-usa.com/exodus/">eXodus 8</a> by Powerlan
USA runs natively on Mac OS X.
It is unknown what codebase it uses and whether/how it supports local
clients.
Because of this, there is no special support for eXodus in Fink.
If you have more info, please throw it our way.
